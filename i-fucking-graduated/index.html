<div class="article">
  <p>Today I checked my grades for the last time.
I can safely say that I have <strong>finally</strong> gotten a gorramn undergraduate degree in Computer Science, with a minor in Mathematics, from Oregon State University. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1">[1]</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id2">[3]</a></p>
<p>I hear that this happens on the reg <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3">[2]</a> but I'm sure that every single person who <em>actually graduates</em> feels amazing when they do.</p>
<p>It's not amazing because graduation is a Herculean feat.
I know I'm not a 60 year old grandmother who dreamt of getting a college degree for 45 years and finally scraped together the cash and time in retirement.
I'm also not a refugee that escaped a war-torn country for an education and a better life.
I'm just another white dude that checked all the boxes.</p>
<p>It wasn't hard for me.
I just had to put my head down and do the work.
But it did take a long ass time.</p>
<p>Honestly my story is exactly like <em>most</em> college graduation stories.
I went to kindergarten, then elementary school, then middle school, then high school, then college, and now life.
I plugged away at school, did what I needed to pass my classes, stressed and lamented, studied hard and eventually the system said &quot;Cool. You're done.&quot;
Along the way I learned how to &quot;play the game&quot; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id4">[4]</a>, albeit a bit late compared to a lot of my peers.</p>
<p>I'm thankful to be in a field which doesn't require a masters or PHD to get a jorb.
Heck my field doesn't really require the degree I got; a surprising number of my friends got well paying jobs sans-degree.</p>
<p>I'm also thankful to graduate without debt.
This came from some kickass parents + grandparents, some work during school, and some bad stuff that happened which ended up paying for abou half of my tuition.</p>
<p>I'm thankful to graduate with wonderful friends, a job, and some passions which make my work-related decisions simple and profitable.</p>
<p>Last, I'm thankful to be <em>done</em>.
Now I can finally focus on <em>learning</em>, my real passion.</p>
<p>I'm gonna have a <a class="reference external" href="https://10barrel.com/beer/crush-cucumber-sour/">Cucumber Sour</a> and celebrate.
Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>School isn't really focused on making sure you <em>learned</em>, it's mostly designed to make sure you can pass tests.
Once you figure this out you can focus on learning for the test instead of trying to grok the material.
I believe the kids call it a &quot;life hack&quot;.</p>
<p>Not that you shouldn't try to grok the material, that just happens to take <em>way</em> longer than test-based learning.
So if you want a personal life, learn for the test; if you want a PHD, learn for the material.</p>
<p class="last">I didn't figure this system out until about Junior year of High School, too late to apply this zen skill to the ACT and SAT, but it was useful in college.</p>
