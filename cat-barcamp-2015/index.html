  <p>This weekend I went to <a class="reference external" href="http://catbarcamp.org/">Cat Barcamp 2015</a>, an unconference run by the PSU
<a class="reference external" href="http://cat.pdx.edu/">Computer Action Team</a>. I went to some awesome talks (and gave one myself).</p>
<p>I enjoyed every talk I went to. Here they are in order:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>History of Cryptography.</strong></dt>
<dd>This was given by one of my OSL co-workers. It didn't contain a ton of new
information for me, but was delivered very well and focused on different
types of cryptography and the context in which each one was developed. I
enjoyed it.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>Haskell on Steroids.</strong></dt>
<dd>I kinda checked out during this talk because I wanted to write my slides...
Wooops. It looked very interesting and mathey though...</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>Introduction to Test Driven Development in Power Shell.</strong></dt>
<dd>Whoa Windows! (actually though, I learned more about Power Shell than I
ever expected to know).</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>MY TALK.</strong></dt>
<dd><a class="reference external" href="#my-talk">(see below)</a></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>A Whirlwind Tour of Lojban.</strong></dt>
<dd>Lojban seems like a cool language. Corbin (previous LUG president) gave
this talk, he's a cool guy... you might even say he's TheMostAwesomeDude.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>Adventures in IT Security: Then and now.</strong></dt>
<dd>I like history. I also like computers. This was a good talk. I am biased.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>Talking to people! (or, How I learned to stop worrying and love the user.)</strong></dt>
<dd>Spoiler: The secret is understanding social cues.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="my-talk">
<h2>My Talk</h2>
<p>I decided on the spur of the moment to give a talk 'How to Write a (very
mediocre) Static Site Generator' and with only 40 minutes of prep work I was
able to fill an hour pretty well.</p>
<p>Here are some links from that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/ElijahCaine/0ee1ef21692f3cbb6934">demo code</a>.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="http://elijahcaine.me/catbarcamp2015-demo/">abomination of a website</a> we built between the demo and the end of the
session (epilepsy warning... no seriously).</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="http://slides.elijahcaine.me/cat-barcamp-2015_how-to-an-ssg/">very sparse slides</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="tldr">
<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p>The CAT is an awesome group of people. I'm glad I was able to get a few LUG
members to come to the event. If I went to PSU I would be honored to work with
the CAT. They throw a hellofan event.</p>
