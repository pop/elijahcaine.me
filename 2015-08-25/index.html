<h2>PDX -&gt; AMS</h2>
<p>The flight was uneventful. It was the longest one I've ever been on, which is
always a rough milestone to overcome, but actually one of the better flights
I've taken. TIL Delta's service does not suck.</p>
<p>I usually sleep the entire way to &lt;insert location here&gt;, but I managed to stay
productive (coding, reading, writing) for the majority of flight. I must say,
it was nice to have my own personal screen to catch up on Last Week Tonight.
I've wanted to watch that show for ages...</p>
<p>[<em>Lazy bliss not pictured</em>]</p>
<p>So good.</p>

<h2>Day 0: Part 1</h2>
<p>So I wrote down some thoughts about Amsterdam thus far:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>People keep using fake made up words. What's up with that?</li>
<li>The roads are tiny but people keep driving on them. It looks like chaos but I
haven't seen an accident yet. I'm kinda impressed. People aren't even yelling
at each other about almost getting hit.</li>
<li>The toilet paper squares are actually rectangles. It might just be the toilet
paper at the place I am staying. Either way, I can't deal with this aspect
ratio change. I might not be able to poop in Amsterdam.</li>
<li><strong>COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE</strong></li>
<li>The trains are so quiet. I didn't want to get off...</li>
<li><strong>BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's some pictures I took:</p>
<img alt="Mostly trees and sky." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe2015/amsterdam-view.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p><em>The view from the location I am staying at.</em></p>
<img alt="Panorama of an Amsterdam park." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe2015/amsterdam-park-panorama.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p><em>A panorama from the park outside of where I am staying.</em></p>
<img alt="Goats!" class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe2015/amsterdam-goats.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p><em>Some goats I found.</em></p>
<p>Aaaaaaaand naptime.</p>

<h2>Day 0: Part 2</h2>
<p>I finished today by going to the Red Light District. There
were a lot of half naked ladies in windows. They kept winking
at me. I'm pretty sure they liked me; it's not like they
<em>definitely</em> have a monetary incentive to get my attention or
anything.</p>
<p>I ended up finding a bar and enjoying a Belgian White Beer.
It tasted <a class="reference external" href="https://xkcd.com/1534/">surprisingly good</a></p>

<p><em>So this is what it feels like to drink in a bar... neat.</em></p>
