<h2>The Rijks Museum</h2>
<img alt="A panorama of an Amsterdam canal." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/amsterdam-canal.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p><em>I'm not sure which street I took this panorama on, but I think it looks
awesome. It captures the Amsterdam canal street pretty well.</em></p>
<p>Today I went to the Rijks Museum and had a bit of a culture overload.</p>
<img alt="Chilling with the milk maid." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/amsterdam-milk-maid.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>Everybody got selfies with Van Gough, so I got a selfie The Milkmaid.  I
realize in retrospect that it doesn't work as well.</p>
<p>In other news, this is my face when I realized the bathroom stalls go from
floor to ceiling.</p>
<img alt="Surprise and joy." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/amsterdam-all-the-way.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p><em>Yes, this photo was taken in the bathroom stall.</em></p>
<p>And this is a classy restaurant I found with classy lamps.</p>

<p><em>They were closed, otherwise I would have gone in.</em></p>

<h2>Some Travel Tips</h2>
<p>Although I have not completed my trip, I have some tips to share
with you about travel.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Always bring a 'Go Bag' when you go out for the day. Fill it with snacks and
necessities and leave plenty of room for memorabilia you get while out and
about.</li>
<li>Try something new before defaulting to your comfort zone. This is true for
food as well as experiences.</li>
<li>Always being plenty of snacks and water. You will regret it if you don't.</li>
<li>Be patient. You invested a lot to get here, make it count.</li>
<li>At a museum, take a picture of the plackard after taking a picture of the
piece so you don't forget what it's called.</li>
<li>Don't be afraid to sit in a café and just read for a bit. Sometimes that's as
culturally diversifying as a day in a museum or city tour.</li>
</ul>
