  <p>Computing is a big field.
When I was getting my computer science degree I knew there were at least a dozen specialties I could go into.
All of these felt like entirely different worlds separated huge vallies of time needed to learn the basics all over again.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Back-end web dev: Producing value for users with reasonably fast turnaround. Integrating with other systems.</li>
<li>Crytography: Math and proofs; correctness is paramount.</li>
<li>Front-end web dev: Platform quirks; browsers aren't all the same.</li>
<li>Operations: Learning hundreds of tools and how they work together; maintaining complex systems.</li>
<li>Networking dev: Gotta go fast; speed is paramount.</li>
<li>Games dev: Do a bunch of complex stuff, 60-120 times per second. And make it fun.</li>
<li>Mobile app dev: Front-end development with a heavier IDE.</li>
<li>Graphics: Physics that needs to look pretty and be fast.</li>
<li>Operating systems: Squeezing every bit out of the computer.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This is far from a complete list, and most of my assumptions about these fields, even the ones I have experience in, are nieve.
The point is that these fields overlap in that they all uses computers, but differ wildly after scratching the surface.</p>
</div>
<p>This of course ignores the even wider world of computer engineering.
I don't even know enough about circuit boards and hardware to make a glib guess about it.</p>
<div class="section" id="developers-and-programmers">
<h2>Developers and Programmers</h2>
<blockquote>
OK, that's cool but like what's your point?</blockquote>
<p>I've been a back-end web developer and DevOps‚Ñ¢ engineer since before I graduated in 2017.
I'm very comfortable working at a high level of abstraction.
I treat computers as black boxes that magically turn my elegant algorithms into changing colors on a screen.</p>
<p>Sometimes I can spot performance bugs like this:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="n">new_stuff</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">obj</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">some_queryset</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">new_thing</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">transform_thing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">new_stuff</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">new_thing</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">new_stuff</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre>
<p>where I think &quot;Hmm, that's going to be slow if <tt class="docutils literal">some_queryset</tt> is like big&quot;.</p>
<p>I call working at this higher level of abstraction &quot;developing&quot;.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Developer</dt>
<dd>A devleoper turns compute into value, abstracted away the details of that compute.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is in contrast with a _programmer_ who is focused on the physical computer.
A Programmer not only catches obvious bugs like calculating unecessary values, but asks &quot;Is this program written for a computer&quot;.
Programmers think about cache hits and misses, context switches, byte allignment, and in squeezing computers for all their worth.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Programmer</dt>
<dd>A programmer writes software with the computer it runs on in mind.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Growing up, and even after I started working full time, I considered these two words interchangable.
A programmer and a devleoper were basically the same title and you just used whichever was more appropriate.</p>
<p>I'm not a fan of splitting hairs between words, so what's my point?</p>
<p>Drawing a distinction between Developer and Programmer got me to think what I _currently_ do with computers, and what I _want_ to do with them next.</p>

<h2>Getting close to the metal</h2>
<p>I've been <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pop/rust-action-heroes/">dabbling with programming games</a> for a few months and it is... challenging.</p>
<p>I'm very familiar with the patterns of web development and I like working in that space.
It's lucritive, in relatively high demand, and I've gotten good at it.</p>
<p>Games on the other hand I don't have a ledge to hold on to.</p>
<p>I'm overwhelemed by graphics, the complex game engines, how hyper aware I need to be of performance.
It feels like I've spent _years_ learning about how to write software for computers and I opened a door and found an entirely different world.</p>
<p>Catching up to the point where I can make good games feels incredibly daunting, and I am _very_ excited.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-i-learn">
<h2>How I learn</h2>
<p>Here's how I learn something totally new:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ask the obvious question. &quot;How do I program games?&quot;</li>
<li>This spawns more questions. &quot;How do I program a graphics engine?&quot;</li>
<li>This spawns yet more questions. &quot;What algorithms do I need for this?&quot;</li>
<li>Again and again... &quot;What is a dot-product of two vectors?&quot;</li>
<li>Until I hit bedrock. &quot;I have derived how dot-products work.&quot;</li>
<li>Then the entire chain of questions get anwswered.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the algorithmically minded, this is like a depth-first search.
I don't feel like I understand anything until I've asked and answered every question up the stack.</p>
<p>In practics I don't actually drill down this directly.
I usually do a bunch slower &quot;breadth-first&quot; search where I ask a lot of questions randomly until I hit bedrock and everything clicks.</p>
<p>This is very fulfilling in the end, I have a deep understanding of what I'm doing and I'm able to reason about what I'm doing at a few levels -- but it's incredibly slow and I give up before I get to the bottom of things.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="let-s-program-games">
<h2>Let's program games</h2>
<p>I'm really interested in making games, but I'm having a hard time picking up different engines.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Unity and Unreal are power hogs and I don't have the patience to learn what all the buttons do.</li>
<li>Amethyst and Bevy are good Rust frameworks, but I still haven't hit bedrock.</li>
</ul>
<p>So becuase I'm very good at convincing myself of bad ideas, let's dig into how games work and learn the fundimentals.
Not becuase I want to write a game engine completely from scratch, I'm not Jonathan Blow.
Once I understand how higher level engines work I'll enjoy working with them, or I will have the power to fix them if I don't like them.</p>
