<p>Like many of you, I really like games.
I enjoy playing games, talking about games, and a few times I've even tried making games.
I enjoy making games for a few reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Games are an interesting technical challenge.</li>
<li>They are a flexible artistic outlet.</li>
<li>I don't make games in my day-job (yay hobbies).</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm also interested in this programming language called Rust!
You might have heard of it.
Rust is a maturing systems programming language which aims to be performant, reliable, and productive.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Performant in that it often goes head to head with C and C++ in benchmarks.</li>
<li>Reliable in that it refuses to compile memory unsafe code.</li>
<li>Productive because it includes &quot;zero cost abstractions&quot; (link <tt class="docutils literal">filter</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">map</tt>) and awesome tooling.</li>
</ul>
<p>The community is pretty good too!</p>
<p>This post is about bringing those two interests together.
Let's learn how to build a videogame with the Rust programming language.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>This post is for folks who have a passing familiarity with Rust.
If Rust is new to you, you get a little confused.</p>

<div class="section" id="making-games-entities-components-systems">
<h2>Making Games: Entities, Components, Systems ⚙️</h2>
<p>Games are an incredibly fun and flexible type of project to work on.</p>
<p>At it's core, all games need a &quot;game loop&quot;:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Process input</li>
<li>Transforms state</li>
<li>Display new state</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ol>
<p>Outside of that, the possibilities are endless.
But while the <em>possibilities</em> are endless, there are a few <em>patterns</em> that lots of folks seem to gravitate toward.</p>
<p>You could write a whole book on game programming patterns (and somebody has, links at the bottom).
Today we're going to talk about one popular pattern: <strong>ECS: Entity Component System</strong>.
Here's what that looks like:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Components</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Pieces of data mixed, matched, and queried on.</p>
<p class="last">Example: Some components needed to simulate physics might be &quot;Mass&quot;, &quot;Movable&quot;, and &quot;Friction&quot;</p>
</dd>
<dt>Entities</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A Unique ID associated with a collection of Components.</p>
<p>Example: Potted plant you can break have the following components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sprite(&quot;/path/to/plant.png&quot;)</li>
<li>Mass(6.8)</li>
<li>Movable(True)</li>
<li>Location((2, 5, 2))</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these components are reusable.
Instead of creating a &quot;PottedPlant&quot; class in code, we can define each entity in a config file like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
potted-plant.txt:
Sprite /path/to/plant.png
Mass 6.8
Movable True
Location 2 5 2
</pre>
<p>This makes our engine much more reusable and separates our content from our logic.</p>
<p class="last">But how do we use these components?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Systems</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Functions that operate on entities with specific components.</p>
<p>A System queries for all entities with a specific subset of components and does some transformation on it.</p>
<p>Example: a system that applies fire damage to an entity might look like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
entities_on_fire = entities.query(on_fire=True, health &gt; 0)
for entity in entities_on_fire:
    entity.health -= 5
</pre>
<p class="last">This is nice compared with a classes-based approach where we would need to manage inheritance to manually make sure everything interacted correctly.
Here we define systems based on what features an entity has.
The resulting systems and components interact with eachother in interesting and potentially unexpected ways.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>ECS is a popular pattern for creating interactive games and simulations.
Engines like Unity have some ECS patterns built in, and almost every big game engine uses ECS in some way.</p>
<p>Of course ECS isn't a silver bullet, but for this blog post it's good enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tools-of-the-trade-c-and-c">
<h2>Tools of the Trade: C and C++ ⚒️</h2>
<p>C and C++ are very popular languages in games programming.
They are defacto in the industry and many large engines, both internal and licensed engines, are written in C++.</p>
<p>I'm not here to bash on C and C++, but it can be useful to point out why you would bother using Rust if the norm is C++.</p>
<p>The usual arguments in favor of Rust go a little something like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Rust is memory safe; in Rust it is very difficult to reference freed memory, mutate memory in two threads, and dereference a null pointer.</li>
<li>Rust is expressive; a lot of functional-programming language features exist in Rust without the usual run-time cost of those languages.</li>
<li>Rust doesn't have any of the C/C++ legacy baggage but <em>can</em> inter-operate with C/C++ codebases.</li>
<li>Rust has a kick-ass community and an ecosystem of battle-tested and safe code.</li>
</ul>
<p>So why does this all matter for games?
I think of it it like this: Any project when it gets sufficiently complex benefits from Rust.
Rust, by preventing a whole class of memory bugs, makes it easier to maintain a complex codebase over time.
It might not be life or death, or as mission critical as security software, but completely avoiding null-pointer bugs, at essentially no performance cost, sounds like a huge weight off my shoulders.</p>
<p>Games are by their nature huge and sprawling codebases.
Many bugs in games are caught by a compiler, but even more errors would be caught by the Rust borrow-checker.
And being able to use some of the nice functional-programming features would be nice too.</p>
<p>Of course Rust is a relatively new language so your mileage may vary.
If I ran a big game studio I don't think I would throw out my C++ code and start fresh with Rust, but I would definitely put some research and development into it for new projects (said the Rust fanboy).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rusty-games-hello-amethyst">
<h2>Rusty Games: Hello Amethyst 💎</h2>
<p>Writing games in a safe, expressive, not C/C++ language sounds great; where do I start?</p>
<p>You could write a game from scratch, but there are engines written in Rust you can use today!
Some of these focus on ease of use, some are for 2D games, some focus on compiling for the web.
Most of these engines require you to write Rust, as opposed to using a GUI, but even that is changing.</p>
<p>For a comprehensive list check out <a class="reference external" href="https://www.arewegameyet.rs">https://www.arewegameyet.rs</a></p>
<p>You could write this talk for almost any Rust Game Engine, but my personal favorite is Amethyst, so we'll use that.
Amethyst has a solid API, very active community, and is a good mix of flexible, convenient, and powerful.</p>
<p>Amethyst checks off a few other boxes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Implements an ECS runtime. Register Components, create Entities, and run Systems in Amethyst.</li>
<li>Data driven design. Almost all data in Amethyst can be read in from a Config file.</li>
<li>Apache + MIT licensed. Free as in speech is always nice.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="step-0-join-the-cargo-cult">
<h3>Step 0: Join the Cargo Cult</h3>
<p>In this step we're going to get Rust setup and create a &quot;hello world&quot; rust project.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, setup your Rust toolchain and start a Rust project.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Install <tt class="docutils literal">rustup</tt>, the Rust toolchain manager.</li>
<li>Run <tt class="docutils literal">rustup toolchain install stable</tt> to install the latest stable Rust.</li>
<li>Run <tt class="docutils literal">cargo new <span class="pre">seagl-game</span></tt> to create a &quot;hello world&quot; Rust application.</li>
<li>Navigate to the new <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seagl-game</span></tt> folder. Add this to the end of our project's metadata file, <tt class="docutils literal">Cargo.toml</tt>:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code literal-block">
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies.amethyst]
version = &quot;0.15.1&quot;
features = [&quot;vulkan&quot;]  # &quot;metal&quot; on MacOS
</pre>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>Run <tt class="docutils literal">cargo build</tt> to build and cache our dependencies. You should see a <strong>bunch</strong> of output like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code literal-block">
$ cargo build
...
Compiling either v1.6.1
Compiling gimli v0.23.0
Compiling adler v0.2.3
Compiling object v0.22.0
...
</pre>
<p>Now we have a &quot;hello world&quot; Rust project we can start building on.</p>

<div class="section" id="step-1-draw-a-window">
<h3>Step 1: Draw a Window 📐</h3>
<p>Before we run, we need to walk.
And before we walk we crawl.
And before we crawl we draw a window.
This is, of course, a little harder than just asking your computer &quot;Please draw me a window&quot;.</p>
<p>First we need to add a bunch of imports to our project:</p>

<p>Then modify our Seagl entity like so:</p>

<span class="gi">+ let sprite = SpriteRender::new(sprite_sheet_handle.clone(), 0);</span>
  let seagl = Seagl::default();
  data.world
      .create_entity()
      .with(seagl)
<span class="gi">+     .with(sprite)</span>
      .with(transform)
      .build();
</pre></div>
<p>Let's see.
We created a Seagl entity. Let's try running this thing:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
$ cargo run
...
thread 'main' panicked at 'Tried to fetch resource of type `MaskedStorage&lt;Seagl&gt;`[^1] from the `World`, but the resource does not exist.

You may ensure the resource exists through one of the following methods:

* Inserting it when the world is created: `world.insert(..)`.
* If the resource implements `Default`, include it in a system's `SystemData`, and ensure the system is registered in the dispatcher.
* If the resource does not implement `Default`, insert it in the world during `System::setup`.
</pre>
<p>Hmm.
It seems like our <tt class="docutils literal">Seagl</tt> Component isn't registered with Amethyst.
This happens implicitly when we add a system that uses our component, but until we write a System, we'll have to explicitly register our Component with Amethyst.</p>
<p>Add this toward the top of our <tt class="docutils literal">on_start</tt> method:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">world</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">register</span>::<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Seagl</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">();</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Let's try running again:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
$ cargo run
...

error: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: &quot;No such file or directory&quot; } } }), backtrace: None,

<p>Ah, a different runtime error.
This time we forgot to add our spritesheet image and spritesheet config file.
Lets add those.</p>
<p>Add this code to a file in <tt class="docutils literal">assets/texture/spritesheet.ron</tt>:</p>

<h3>Step 3: Move Around 🏇</h3>
<p>Thinking back to our ECS discussion, we have two of the three ingredients: an Entity, some Components, but no Systems!</p>
<p>First, we need to create a System struct and implement <tt class="docutils literal">System</tt> on it.</p>
<p>Our System's run function looks like this in psuedocode:</p>
<pre class="code text literal-block">
for every seagl that can move:
    If the user input was to move horizontal:
        Move the seagl horizontally
    If the user input was to move vertical:
        Move the seagl vertically
</pre>
<p>This doesn't look _exactly_ the same in Rust, but it's pretty close.</p>

<p>We declare a <tt class="docutils literal">SystemData</tt> type which is a tuple of components.
The <tt class="docutils literal">Transform</tt> component will be modified, so we require it as <tt class="docutils literal">mut</tt>, but everything else is <tt class="docutils literal">Read</tt> for stuff that Amethyst provides and <tt class="docutils literal">ReadStorage</tt> for things we created.</p>
<p>We loop over every entity with the <tt class="docutils literal">Seagl</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Transform</tt> components, then we match against any user input:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If we had &quot;vertical&quot;  input, move the entity on the x axis.</li>
<li>If we had &quot;horizontal&quot; input, move the entity on the y axis.</li>
<li>We don't need to explicitly say &quot;move left&quot;/&quot;move right&quot; because the horizontal/vertical inputs can be positive or negative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next we need to register this system with out game.
Because we are using Inputs we also need to register the inputs bundle with the game.</p>

<p>We have a dependency on the <tt class="docutils literal">input_system</tt>, so Amethyst will ensure that system runs before <tt class="docutils literal">move_system</tt>.</p>
<p>Next we need to create a config file for our movement bindings.
Instead of hard-coding &quot;Up arrow means move up, down arrow means down&quot; we put that in config files:</p>

<p>This is a good start, but you'll notice the Seagl doesn't turn left and right, this _totally_ breaks my suspension of disbelief so we're gonna need to fix that in our <tt class="docutils literal">run</tt> method:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gh">diff --git a/src/main.rs b/src/main.rs</span>

      transform.prepend_translation_x(

  if let Some(vertical) = input.axis_value(&quot;vertical&quot;) {

<p>In our &quot;horizontal&quot; check we added:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the input was greater than 0, flip our sprite on the Y axis.</li>
<li>If the input was less than 0, reset our sprite on the Y axis.</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes it look like our Seagl is facing the direction they're moving which should help boost our Metacritic score when we publish this at the end of the blogpost.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>We rotate by PI because our 2D sprite is in the 3D world and we're rotating it in radians.</p>

<div class="section" id="step-4-eat-some-food">
<h3>Step 4: Eat some food! 🍔</h3>
<p>I'm sure we could all get _minutes_ of fun out of moving our seagl around the screen, but this game could really use something else...
Something tastier.</p>
<p>Let's add burgers.</p>
<p>This will require us to do everything we just did, again:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Add a Food Compnent.</li>
<li>Create a Burger entity with the food component.</li>
<li>Add an Eat system.</li>
<li>Register our Eat system with the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>First we need to add a food Component.</p>
<p>Add this component anywhere that feels right:</p>
<pre class="code rust literal-block">
<span class="cp">#[derive(Default)]</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nc">Food</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre>
<p>It's structurally identical to our Seagl, but with a different <tt class="docutils literal">struct</tt> it's a totally different component.</p>
<p>With a Food component we can add our Burger entity.
Add this code to our <tt class="docutils literal">on_setup</tt> function at the end:</p>
<pre class="code rust literal-block">

<p>We create an entity spawning it at the point (75, 75, -1).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>We spawn the burger at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">z=-1</span></tt> to ensure the Seagl sprite is closer to the camera and thus is drawn on top of the burger.</p>
<p class="last">Have you ever seen a Seagull _behind_ a burger?
That's ridiculous.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>A few exercises left to the reader:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>How would you spawn multiple burgers?</li>
<li>How would you re-spawn burgers when one is eaten?</li>
<li>How would you keep track of how many burgers were eaten?</li>
<li>How would you display the number of burgers eaten?</li>
</ol>
<p class="last">I've only covered enough in this post to answer the first two.</p>
</div>
<p>And finally an &quot;eat&quot; system.</p>
<p>This system's pseudocode looks like this:</p>
<pre class="code text literal-block">
For each seagl with a location:
    For each Food with a location:
        If the Seagl overlaps with the Food:
            Destory that food
</pre>
<p>This is a bit of a hack.
If this were a real game we would keep track of how many burgers the Seagl ate, but for this demo, we'll be lazy:</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>We did it.
We made a lil' game.
It had a Seagl and a burger.
And we had fun making it.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say it's <em>easy</em> to make games in Rust, but we are <em>very far</em> from having to write games from scratch.</p>
