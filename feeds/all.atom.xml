</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So you're interested in buying a house eh?
Well boy howdy do I have a series of blog posts for you.
This four part series will equip you, a first-time home buyer, with a bunch of knowledge I wish I had before starting my journey to buying a home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the road-map:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="buying-a-house-01-lets-go-shopping"&gt;Part 1: 🛒 Let's Go Shopping!&lt;/a&gt; in which we start looking for houses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 2: &lt;strong&gt;💸 Show Me the Money!&lt;/strong&gt; in which we buy a freaking house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 3: &lt;strong&gt;👷 Renovation Station.&lt;/strong&gt; in which we live in the freaking house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 4: &lt;strong&gt;📈 Is This Investing?&lt;/strong&gt; where we figure out if we made a huge financial mistake (or achievement!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hey-quick-disclaimer"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hey, quick disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things I &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; claim to be an expert on: Docker, Linux, why my dog is making that face, etc.
But with home-buying I am at best a novice, so please take everything you read here with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am just one lowly home owner in his mid-20s who bought a house during a pandemic.
I got here through a bunch of privilege, support, luck, and the modest amount amount of hard work &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; to live a wonderful mortgage-filled life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a financial advisor, realtor, none of that stuff.
I encourage you to do independent research, check my work, etc.
Don't make any decisions based purely on this series.
Please use it as one of many sources in your research before buying a house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt; we can get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="so-um-why-do-you-want-to-buy-a-house"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So um, why do you want to buy a house?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the home buying process, let's ask an annoyingly simple (but annoyingly effective) question: &amp;quot;why?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a million reasons to want to buy a house.
A few that come to mind are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want more space or a yard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want an investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to be in a residential neighborhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to fulfill the American Dream™.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now none of these &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; you to buy a house.
You could rent a house to get more space, invest in high yield assets to make passive income, etc. but a house tends to check &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; these boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fiance (now wife) and I we were living in a small apartment before buying a house.
This apartment was perfect pre-COVID.
It was a 10-20 minutes walking commute to work, centrally located, and big enough to sleep, cook meals, and rest while being young 20-somethings living our best lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When COVID hit we though we could muddle through in the apartment, but around the 2 month mark we thought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hmm, this isn't gonna be the &amp;quot;Come on Morty. Just two weeks, we'll be in and out. Just a little pandemic to spice things up.&amp;quot; thing that we thought this would be...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked for house rentals, but while there were hundreds of houses for sale there were almost no houses rentals available in the Portland area.
I was always resistant to buying a house, but after realizing it was a reasonable financial decision we got started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where our home buying journey begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="let-s-triage"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let's triage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before buying a house, or even visiting a house, you should go to sites like Zillow and Redfin to get a lay of the land.
They both have basically the same home listings, so choose whichever site has a better interface for you.
This goes without saying though; you found this obscure blog post so you're probably deeply familiar with all the different home buying sites.
I promise this series will start saying less &amp;quot;yeah duh&amp;quot; stuff in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew roughly what neighborhoods we wanted to live in: East Portland with a bias toward the Tabor neighborhoods.
This made it quick to narrow our search and skip the existential question &amp;quot;where in the world do I want to live?&amp;quot; I'm sure some people confront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="money-talk"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Money talk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have a feel for the housing market in your target locations, check in with your finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-big-wad-of-cash"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A big wad of cash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying your soon-to-be house will require a down-payment.
This means you'll need a very big pile of money &lt;em&gt;very soon&lt;/em&gt;.
Figure out what your liquid assets (savings, non-retirement investment accounts, dubious favors you can call in) talley up to.
This is the max you could use for a down-payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down payments tend to be 20% of the purchase price of the house, and houses are hundreds of thousands of dollars, so... yeah that's a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have 20k in usable assets, you can afford a down payment on a 100k house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;84k usable assets? 420k house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13.8k usable assets? 69k house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sets an upper-limit on which houses you can afford.
Hopefully this upper-limit lines up with median home prices in your target neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-smaller-monthly-wad-of-cash"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A smaller monthly wad of cash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also need to consider the monthly cost of your potential home.
Ideally you only spend up to 30% of your monthly income on living expenses.
This means your house (with utilities) costs no more than 30% of what you take home.
Some of you may be laughing at this because it is in fact an outdated metric that has not kept up with inflating home prices.
Don't worry, we'll cover how terrible home prices are in a later installment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30% rule says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you take home 2k/month (roughly a 30k/year salary after taxes) your housing should cost no more than 600/month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5833/month (100k salary) take-home? 1750 housing expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11452/month (200k salary) take-home? 3435 housing expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does that translate to for home prices?
You don't pay for the whole house up front (the bank does that).
Instead you pay for it in monthly installments with interest -- which is hard for me to intuit.
Skipping some prelude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your house is 100k, you put up a 20k down payment, and you acquire a 30 year loan with 4% interest, your monthly payment will be ~587.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200k house, 40k down, 4% interest 30yr loan? ~1070.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these numbers, as the price of the house goes up the monthly payments go up sub-linearly.
This means so a 400k house is a little less than 2000/month, ec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how to calculate these numbers by hand, I always use a calculator... &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/"&gt;https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have established you can afford both the down-payment and monthly payments now we can start shopping!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If prices in your target neighborhood are out of reach, explore other candidates; neighborhoods near your targets, or even the 'burbs.
Also if you just like shopping for homes for the kick of it, because shopping is fun, power to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="get-yourself-a-realtor"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get yourself a realtor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A realtor is like a lawyer.
You never &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; one, but they are incredible necessary for some of life's biggest shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were #blessed to have a family friend that was an active realtor; her name is Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship we had with our realtor was like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every week around Tuesday we would send her a list of houses we wanted to see. Between 5-10 houses every week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasionally she would also find a house she thought we would be interested in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first week she picked about half the houses to get a feel for what we were interested in, and we brought some we found on our own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She would drive us around to these houses, because we refuse to buy a car and she is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mary would schedule a time for us to visit the house, around 30 minutes per house, during this time we were the only ones in the homes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a card-carrying realtor Mary had special privileges not given to us normies, and information not found on public sites.
For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mary had a list of things disclosed about the house like &amp;quot;It's very full of asbestos&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;It's full of radon&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The roof caved in last year, just fixed&amp;quot;. Info you would want to know before putting an offer on a house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She also had access to some cloak-and-dagger shit that let her into all of the houses on the market. Ever seen a lock-box on a for-sale house? She could open that lock-box and get the key out with an app on her phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She also knew how to fill out the copious forms needed to put an offer on a house, but we'll get to that in the next post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="so-many-houses"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So. Many. Houses.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total we were house shopping for about 5 weeks.
We averaged visiting 10 houses per week, doing 1 to 2 trips per week and visiting 6 houses per trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw a lot of houses.
Some great houses in safe boring neighborhoods far from where we wanted to live.
Some terrible houses that people kept calling &amp;quot;fixer-uppers&amp;quot; like they were in the pocket of big shitty house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of houses that were great except for like... one really important thing.
Some houses had a great location but were too small.
Or the house was the perfect size but too far from our target location.
Or the price and size were good but the neighbors were burning a literal pile of trash and they were like... very good at it, implying this wasn't a one-off thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is, there were a lot of houses.
A lot that were good, many more that were non-starters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first week or two was basically a mulligan.
So many houses are so bad you start to think &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; houses are bad and you trick yourself into settling.
DO NOT SETTLE.
This is a huge freaking purchase, grind it out and you will find a house you like.
It might be at the upper end of your budget, or it might be a &lt;em&gt;little bit of a fixer upper&lt;/em&gt;, but you'll know the perfect house when you find it.
And you will &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; know when it's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the right house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-on-your-knees-and-asking-the-bank-for-a-pre-approval"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting on your knees and asking the bank for a pre-approval&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in the story we haven't bought any houses yet, but before you are allowed to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; about buying a house you need to get a bank to say &amp;quot;Yeah they're good for it&amp;quot;.
This requires asking a bank pretty please, giving them like 3 years of financial, employment, and credit records.
If you're buying this with a partner they need to do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case we tried to get a super cheap loan but we were told our offer might get rejected if we didn't have a &amp;quot;local loan&amp;quot; meaning a loan provided by a local Oregon company -- what year is it 1980?
In the end all of our loan options were super cheap, even the local ones, so we shrugged and told ourselves the cheapest loan probably had a bunch of closing fees that would basically cancel out the higher mortgage rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;fun fact&lt;/em&gt; about the loan process is that you get pre-approved for a loan up to some amount, which is used to put an offer on a house.
Once the offer is accepted you get the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; loan for whatever the final loan amount ends up being.
But we're getting ahead of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-offer-process"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The offer process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point you'll make an offer on a house.
This might &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; like we're buying a house, but trust me there are a lot more offers on houses than there are sales on houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you put in an offer on a house you basically roll for initiative and if you get a Nat-20 it gets accepted.
You should still treat every offer as if it were to be accepted, because you can roll a Nat-20 on a persuasion check with a rat just as often as slaying a dragon.
Offers are accepted and rejected basically at random, but each one is important and should be treated as &amp;quot;the one&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When putting an offer on a house you fill out a bunch of complicated legal-ese forms with your realtor.
Taking your pre-approval you decide on an offer up to your pre-approval limit.
In Portland right now we need to offer &lt;em&gt;way more&lt;/em&gt; than the asking price which is bullshit and I hate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also fill out a bunch of details like when you want the sale to be complete (30 days), weather you're planning on doing inspections (yes), and how much money you can put up &lt;em&gt;before your down payment&lt;/em&gt;.
That pre-down-payment is called Earnest Money and it's often between 2k and 10k, it counts toward your down payment, and it can be refunded if the deal falls through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="it-s-a-marathon-pace-yourself"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's a marathon, pace yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy went into this expecting that buying a house was like buying anything else.
You find what you like, offer a fair (or listed) price, and boom you get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately housing is not like buying a phone, or basically anything else most people spend money on.
In Portland at least supply does not match demand, so prices are not only higher than they ought to be, but the prices are also &lt;em&gt;full of lies&lt;/em&gt;.
The asking price is often 10% below the final price -- if you're lucky!
Plus your offer on a house may be rejected for mysterious reasons.
More than once we were asked to re-submit an offer and to give our &amp;quot;highest and best&amp;quot; offer whatever the fuck that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be prepared to visit at &lt;strong&gt;dozens&lt;/strong&gt; of houses.
Be prepared to make an offer on multiple houses.
You will have your heart broken when you find the perfect house, just to have it swiped out of your hands by a bank, somebody paying all in cash, somebody waiving inspections, or just some jerk that got an offer in half an hour before you did -- that bastard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your time.
This is a big purchase.
It will pay off.
It will get better.
Your patience will be rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck.
See you in the next part where we get to buy a freaking house!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I was on my laptop running an ancient release of Linux called Fedora 30 -- so old COVID wasn't even a twinkle in a bat's eye when it was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this ancient OS I'm have &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;git 2.21.3&lt;/tt&gt; which is like 13 versions behind.  I ask yum -- err &lt;em&gt;dnf&lt;/em&gt; -- if there is an upgrade and it's like &amp;quot;nope&amp;quot;. Nothing makes me feel older than software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've gotten into the habit of naming my default branches &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master&lt;/tt&gt; because every time I say &amp;quot;master&amp;quot; I need to take a shower. I'm pretty sure the latest git names the default branch &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; out of the box, but git from April 2019 was not aware of problematic language choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as one does I'm starting a new repo and I decide before updating &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;git&lt;/tt&gt;, which is gonna require like 3 Fedora upgrades, I'm just going to rename the branch. I know I'll get woke-git if I upgrade Fedora, but I want to write this post first so we're gonna find a workaround.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[branch:master]$ git branch -m main
error: refname refs/heads/master not found
fatal: Branch rename failed
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm. So on a bare repo you can't rename the starting branch because there's no objects in the repo... or something like that &lt;em&gt;waves hands&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umm... I guess we'll go spelunking into the &lt;cite&gt;.git&lt;/cite&gt; directory to see if we can manually force our &lt;cite&gt;main&lt;/cite&gt; branch naming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[branch:master]$ cd .git
[.git]$ tree -F
.
├── branches/
├── config
├── description
├── HEAD
├── hooks/
│   ├── A bunch of sample scripts
├── info/
│   └── exclude
├── objects/
│   ├── info/
│   └── pack/
└── refs/
        ├── heads/
        └── tags/
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well unsurprisingly we have a bunch of empty directories and some sample scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only files that _might_ be worth looking at are &lt;cite&gt;config&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;description&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;HEAD&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;// config
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be config options for this repo, none of which mention branch naming so it's a skip for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;// description
Unnamed repository; edit this file &amp;#39;description&amp;#39; to name the repository.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea this feature existed. I have never seen it be used -- but fun facts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;// HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the money shot. Let's change that bad boy to &lt;cite&gt;refs/heads/main&lt;/cite&gt; and see if my magical git prompt picks it up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[.git]$ cd ../
[branch:main]$
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heyo! There you have it. How to manually change the name of your main branch in a fresh git repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanity check, this won't fuck up if we commit right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ cargo init .
$ git add . &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git commit -m &amp;quot;initial commit&amp;quot;
[main (root-commit) ebecbee] initial commit
 3 files changed, 12 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 create mode 100644 Cargo.toml
 create mode 100644 src/main.rs
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="note"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Note...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After anxiously upgrading to Fedora 34 I confirmed that git fixed a lot of this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[pop@lappy foo]$ git init
hint: Using &amp;#39;master&amp;#39; as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name

hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint:
hint:   git config --global init.defaultBranch &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;
hint:
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of &amp;#39;master&amp;#39; are &amp;#39;main&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;trunk&amp;#39; and

hint:
hint:   git branch -m &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;git branch &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; does work on an empty repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="last"&gt;This is the outline for a talk I gave at the Seattle GNU Linux conference (SeaGL) 2020.
Once the video is posted I will link it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many of you, I really like games.
I enjoy playing games, talking about games, and a few times I've even tried making games.
I enjoy making games for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games are an interesting technical challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are a flexible artistic outlet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't make games in my day-job (yay hobbies).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also interested in this programming language called Rust!
You might have heard of it.
Rust is a maturing systems programming language which aims to be performant, reliable, and productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performant in that it often goes head to head with C and C++ in benchmarks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliable in that it refuses to compile memory unsafe code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Productive because it includes &amp;quot;zero cost abstractions&amp;quot; (link &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;filter&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;map&lt;/tt&gt;) and awesome tooling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community is pretty good too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is about bringing those two interests together.
Let's learn how to build a videogame with the Rust programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition warning"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is for folks who have a passing familiarity with Rust.
If Rust is new to you, you get a little confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;You're a smart cookie though, I'm sure you'll keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="making-games-entities-components-systems"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making Games: Entities, Components, Systems ⚙️&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are an incredibly fun and flexible type of project to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At it's core, all games need a &amp;quot;game loop&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transforms state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display new state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of that, the possibilities are endless.
But while the &lt;em&gt;possibilities&lt;/em&gt; are endless, there are a few &lt;em&gt;patterns&lt;/em&gt; that lots of folks seem to gravitate toward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could write a whole book on game programming patterns (and somebody has, links at the bottom).
Today we're going to talk about one popular pattern: &lt;strong&gt;ECS: Entity Component System&lt;/strong&gt;.
Here's what that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Components&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Pieces of data mixed, matched, and queried on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Example: Some components needed to simulate physics might be &amp;quot;Mass&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Movable&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Friction&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Entities&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;A Unique ID associated with a collection of Components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Potted plant you can break have the following components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprite(&amp;quot;/path/to/plant.png&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mass(6.8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movable(True)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location((2, 5, 2))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these components are reusable.
Instead of creating a &amp;quot;PottedPlant&amp;quot; class in code, we can define each entity in a config file like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
potted-plant.txt:
Sprite /path/to/plant.png
Mass 6.8
Movable True
Location 2 5 2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes our engine much more reusable and separates our content from our logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;But how do we use these components?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Systems&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Functions that operate on entities with specific components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A System queries for all entities with a specific subset of components and does some transformation on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: a system that applies fire damage to an entity might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
entities_on_fire = entities.query(on_fire=True, health &amp;gt; 0)
for entity in entities_on_fire:
    entity.health -= 5
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;This is nice compared with a classes-based approach where we would need to manage inheritance to manually make sure everything interacted correctly.
Here we define systems based on what features an entity has.
The resulting systems and components interact with eachother in interesting and potentially unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ECS is a popular pattern for creating interactive games and simulations.
Engines like Unity have some ECS patterns built in, and almost every big game engine uses ECS in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course ECS isn't a silver bullet, but for this blog post it's good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tools-of-the-trade-c-and-c"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools of the Trade: C and C++ ⚒️&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C and C++ are very popular languages in games programming.
They are defacto in the industry and many large engines, both internal and licensed engines, are written in C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not here to bash on C and C++, but it can be useful to point out why you would bother using Rust if the norm is C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual arguments in favor of Rust go a little something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rust is memory safe; in Rust it is very difficult to reference freed memory, mutate memory in two threads, and dereference a null pointer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rust is expressive; a lot of functional-programming language features exist in Rust without the usual run-time cost of those languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rust doesn't have any of the C/C++ legacy baggage but &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; inter-operate with C/C++ codebases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rust has a kick-ass community and an ecosystem of battle-tested and safe code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does this all matter for games?
I think of it it like this: Any project when it gets sufficiently complex benefits from Rust.
Rust, by preventing a whole class of memory bugs, makes it easier to maintain a complex codebase over time.
It might not be life or death, or as mission critical as security software, but completely avoiding null-pointer bugs, at essentially no performance cost, sounds like a huge weight off my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are by their nature huge and sprawling codebases.
Many bugs in games are caught by a compiler, but even more errors would be caught by the Rust borrow-checker.
And being able to use some of the nice functional-programming features would be nice too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course Rust is a relatively new language so your mileage may vary.
If I ran a big game studio I don't think I would throw out my C++ code and start fresh with Rust, but I would definitely put some research and development into it for new projects (said the Rust fanboy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rusty-games-hello-amethyst"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rusty Games: Hello Amethyst 💎&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing games in a safe, expressive, not C/C++ language sounds great; where do I start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could write a game from scratch, but there are engines written in Rust you can use today!
Some of these focus on ease of use, some are for 2D games, some focus on compiling for the web.
Most of these engines require you to write Rust, as opposed to using a GUI, but even that is changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a comprehensive list check out &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.arewegameyet.rs"&gt;https://www.arewegameyet.rs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could write this talk for almost any Rust Game Engine, but my personal favorite is Amethyst, so we'll use that.
Amethyst has a solid API, very active community, and is a good mix of flexible, convenient, and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amethyst checks off a few other boxes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implements an ECS runtime. Register Components, create Entities, and run Systems in Amethyst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data driven design. Almost all data in Amethyst can be read in from a Config file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apache + MIT licensed. Free as in speech is always nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="step-0-join-the-cargo-cult"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 0: Join the Cargo Cult&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this step we're going to get Rust setup and create a &amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot; rust project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't already, setup your Rust toolchain and start a Rust project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;rustup&lt;/tt&gt;, the Rust toolchain manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;rustup toolchain install stable&lt;/tt&gt; to install the latest stable Rust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cargo new &lt;span class="pre"&gt;seagl-game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to create a &amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot; Rust application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the new &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;seagl-game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; folder. Add this to the end of our project's metadata file, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies.amethyst]
version = &amp;quot;0.15.1&amp;quot;
features = [&amp;quot;vulkan&amp;quot;]  # &amp;quot;metal&amp;quot; on MacOS
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cargo build&lt;/tt&gt; to build and cache our dependencies. You should see a &lt;strong&gt;bunch&lt;/strong&gt; of output like this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ cargo build
...
Compiling either v1.6.1
Compiling gimli v0.23.0
Compiling adler v0.2.3
Compiling object v0.22.0
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have a &amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot; Rust project we can start building on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="step-1-draw-a-window"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Draw a Window 📐&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we run, we need to walk.
And before we walk we crawl.
And before we crawl we draw a window.
This is, of course, a little harder than just asking your computer &amp;quot;Please draw me a window&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to add a bunch of imports to our project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;amethyst&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assets&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;AssetStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;core&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timing&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TransformBundle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;derive&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;SystemDesc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ecs&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DenseVecStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Entities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ReadStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SystemData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WriteStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;InputBundle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;InputHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StringBindings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prelude&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;renderer&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RenderFlat2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RenderToWindow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;types&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;DefaultBackend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Camera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ImageFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RenderingBundle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SpriteRender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SpriteSheet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SpriteSheetFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Texture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;utils&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;application_root_dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is every dependency we will need for the entire project, so if &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cargo build|run&lt;/tt&gt; complains about unused dependencies, don't worry... we'll get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are including a few useful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we need to add some boiler-plate to our &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// This is necessary to make Rust&amp;#39;s type-checker happy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Our main function technically returns an Amethyst Result&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// It can either return an Amethyst error or a unit value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-&amp;gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;amethyst&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Not required, but a logger very useful&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;amethyst&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;start_logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Default&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Declare some useful variables used to tell Amethyst where our asset files and config files live&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assets_dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app_root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;assets&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;display_config_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app_root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;config&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;display.ron&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Declare a renderer bundle&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Amethyst adds this collection of 2D Render systems to our game&amp;#39;s runtime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;renderer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RenderingBundle&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DefaultBackend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with_plugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RenderToWindow&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_config_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;display_config_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with_clear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with_plugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RenderFlat2D&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Build the game&amp;#39;s systems&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;game_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GameDataBuilder&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with_bundle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;renderer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Build our application, which includes our game data, where our assets live, and our starting state&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assets_dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SeaglState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;game_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Run the game!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Nothing bad happened, so return `()`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(())&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That won't compile because we haven't defined our &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;SeaglState&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ cargo run
...
error[E0425]: cannot find value `SeaglState` in this scope
  --&amp;gt; src/main.rs:17:49
   |
30 |     let mut game = Application::new(assets_dir, SeaglState, game_data)?;
   |                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^ not found in this scope
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's add &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;SeaglState&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// States can store values, but for now we can use a unit-struct&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SeaglState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We get a working state for free by rubber-stamping the &amp;quot;SimpleState&amp;quot; struct onto our SeaglState&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We will implement our own logic for handling state start-up in the next step&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;impl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SimpleState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SeaglState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will add some methods to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;SeaglState&lt;/tt&gt; later, but for now this makes Rust and Amethyst happy enough to compile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we run our code we get a wonderfully cryptic error message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
Compiling seagl-talk v0.1.0 (/home/pop/seagl-talk)
 Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 24.81s
  Running `target/debug/seagl-talk`
Error: Error { inner: Inner { source: None, backtrace: None, error: File(Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: &amp;quot;No such file or directory&amp;quot; }) } }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get errors like this when we have an unhandled exception in our code.
In our &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function, that is any place where we call a function with a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt;, e.g., &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;foo(...)?;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLDT (Too Long Didn't Troubleshoot) this is because we haven't created our display config file!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a new file &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;display.ron&lt;/tt&gt; in a new folder called &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;config/&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// config/display.ron&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;SeaGL!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dimensions&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when we &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cargo run&lt;/tt&gt; we should get a wonderful orange window:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="It worked! We drew a window." src="/assets/images/seagl-2020/blank-window.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="step-2-draw-a-seagl"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Draw a SeaGL 🕊️&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, we have a window but no game!
Let's draw our first character to the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Did you know that SeaGL's mascot is named Patch?
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://seagl.org/news/2020/09/10/naming-contest.html"&gt;https://seagl.org/news/2020/09/10/naming-contest.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we'll create a Component for our Seagl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#[derive(Default)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;pub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Seagl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;impl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Seagl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DenseVecStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;Self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we'll create a Seagl entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;impl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SimpleState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SeaglState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;on_start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StateData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GameData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Transform&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set_translation_xyz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;50.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;50.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;seagl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Seagl&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;create_entity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;seagl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good start, but our Seagl is a spriteless ghost!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition warning"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Seagull ghosts are terrifying.
Add a sprite!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to load the spritesheet into memory.
Add this in our &lt;cite&gt;on_start&lt;/cite&gt; function above where we added the seagl:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_resource&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;texture_storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_resource&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;AssetStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Texture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;texture_handle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;texture/spritesheet.png&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ImageFormat&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;texture_storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sprite_sheet_store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_resource&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;AssetStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SpriteSheet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;texture/spritesheet.ron&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SpriteSheetFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;texture_handle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sprite_sheet_store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then modify our Seagl entity like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gi"&gt;++ main.rs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gu"&gt;@@ impl SimpleState for SeaglState&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gu"&gt;@@ fn on_start(...)&lt;/span&gt;
  let mut transform = Transform::default();
  transform.set_translation_xyz(50.0, 50.0, 0.0);
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+ let sprite = SpriteRender::new(sprite_sheet_handle.clone(), 0);&lt;/span&gt;
  let seagl = Seagl::default();
  data.world
      .create_entity()
      .with(seagl)
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+     .with(sprite)&lt;/span&gt;
      .with(transform)
      .build();
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see.
We created a Seagl entity. Let's try running this thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ cargo run
...
thread 'main' panicked at 'Tried to fetch resource of type `MaskedStorage&amp;lt;Seagl&amp;gt;`[^1] from the `World`, but the resource does not exist.

You may ensure the resource exists through one of the following methods:

* Inserting it when the world is created: `world.insert(..)`.
* If the resource implements `Default`, include it in a system's `SystemData`, and ensure the system is registered in the dispatcher.
* If the resource does not implement `Default`, insert it in the world during `System::setup`.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm.
It seems like our &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Seagl&lt;/tt&gt; Component isn't registered with Amethyst.
This happens implicitly when we add a system that uses our component, but until we write a System, we'll have to explicitly register our Component with Amethyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add this toward the top of our &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;on_start&lt;/tt&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Seagl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's try running again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ cargo run
...
Error { inner: Inner { source: Some(Error { inner: Inner { source: None, backtrace: None,
error: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: &amp;quot;No such file or directory&amp;quot; } } }), backtrace: None,
error: StringError(&amp;quot;Failed to fetch metadata for \&amp;quot;/home/pop/seagl-talk/assets/texture/spritesheet.ron\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;) } }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, a different runtime error.
This time we forgot to add our spritesheet image and spritesheet config file.
Lets add those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add this code to a file in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;assets/texture/spritesheet.ron&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// assets/texture/spritesheet.ron&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;texture_width&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;texture_height&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sprites&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Seagl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Burger&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And save this image to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;assets/texture/spritesheet.png&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Seagl and Burger. 32x16. Pixel on LCD." src="/assets/images/seagl-2020/spritesheet.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if we run &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cargo run&lt;/tt&gt; we get the same blank orange window.
This happened because we forgot to add a Camera to the scene!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add this to the end of our &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;on_start&lt;/tt&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Transform&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set_translation_xyz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;50.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;50.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;create_entity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Camera&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;standard_2d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;100.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;100.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt="That's a nice looking Seagl there..." src="/assets/images/seagl-2020/window-with-seagl.png" /&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;It's so beautifull...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="step-3-move-around"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Move Around 🏇&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back to our ECS discussion, we have two of the three ingredients: an Entity, some Components, but no Systems!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to create a System struct and implement &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;System&lt;/tt&gt; on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our System's run function looks like this in psuedocode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;for every seagl that can move:
    If the user input was to move horizontal:
        Move the seagl horizontally
    If the user input was to move vertical:
        Move the seagl vertically
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't look _exactly_ the same in Rust, but it's pretty close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;derive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SystemDesc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;pub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MoveSystem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;impl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MoveSystem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SystemData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WriteStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ReadStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Seagl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;InputHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StringBindings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transforms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;seagls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Self&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;SystemData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="kt"&gt;f32&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;50.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_seagl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;seagls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transforms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;horizontal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;axis_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;horizontal&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prepend_translation_x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;                    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;horizontal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;delta_seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;f32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vertical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;axis_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;vertical&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prepend_translation_y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;                    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vertical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;delta_seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;f32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We declare a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;SystemData&lt;/tt&gt; type which is a tuple of components.
The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Transform&lt;/tt&gt; component will be modified, so we require it as &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;mut&lt;/tt&gt;, but everything else is &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Read&lt;/tt&gt; for stuff that Amethyst provides and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ReadStorage&lt;/tt&gt; for things we created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We loop over every entity with the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Seagl&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Transform&lt;/tt&gt; components, then we match against any user input:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we had &amp;quot;vertical&amp;quot;  input, move the entity on the x axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we had &amp;quot;horizontal&amp;quot; input, move the entity on the y axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't need to explicitly say &amp;quot;move left&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;move right&amp;quot; because the horizontal/vertical inputs can be positive or negative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we need to register this system with out game.
Because we are using Inputs we also need to register the inputs bundle with the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+++ main.rs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gu"&gt;@@ fn main() -&amp;gt; amethyst::Result&amp;lt;()&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     )
     .with_plugin(RenderFlat2D::default());

&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+    let bindings_path = app_root.join(&amp;quot;config&amp;quot;).join(&amp;quot;bindings.ron&amp;quot;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+    let inputs = InputBundle::&amp;lt;StringBindings&amp;gt;::new().with_bindings_from_file(bindings_path)?;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
     let game_data = GameDataBuilder::default()
         .with_bundle(transform)?
         .with_bundle(renderer)?
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+        .with_bundle(inputs)?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+        .with(MoveSystem, &amp;quot;move_system&amp;quot;, &amp;amp;[&amp;quot;input_system&amp;quot;]);&lt;/span&gt;

     let mut game = Application::new(assets_dir, SeaglState, game_data)?;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a dependency on the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;input_system&lt;/tt&gt;, so Amethyst will ensure that system runs before &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;move_system&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we need to create a config file for our movement bindings.
Instead of hard-coding &amp;quot;Up arrow means move up, down arrow means down&amp;quot; we put that in config files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// config/bindings.ron&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;axes&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;horizontal&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Emulated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;neg&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;vertical&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Emulated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;neg&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Down&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;actions&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt="It moves!" class="align-center" src="/assets/images/seagl-2020/SeaGL-move.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good start, but you'll notice the Seagl doesn't turn left and right, this _totally_ breaks my suspension of disbelief so we're gonna need to fix that in our &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;run&lt;/tt&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gh"&gt;diff --git a/src/main.rs b/src/main.rs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gu"&gt;@@ impl&amp;lt;&amp;#39;s&amp;gt; System&amp;lt;&amp;#39;s&amp;gt; for MoveSystem&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gu"&gt;@@ run(...)&lt;/span&gt;
  if let Some(vertical) = input.axis_value(&amp;quot;vertical&amp;quot;) {
      transform.prepend_translation_x(
        horizontal * time.delta_seconds() * speed  as f32
      );
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+     if horizontal &amp;gt; 0.0 {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+       transform.set_rotation_y_axis(std::f32::consts::PI);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+     }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+     if horizontal &amp;lt; 0.0 {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+       transform.set_rotation_y_axis(0.0);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+     }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
  };
  if let Some(vertical) = input.axis_value(&amp;quot;vertical&amp;quot;) {
      transform.prepend_translation_y(
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &amp;quot;horizontal&amp;quot; check we added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the input was greater than 0, flip our sprite on the Y axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the input was less than 0, reset our sprite on the Y axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes it look like our Seagl is facing the direction they're moving which should help boost our Metacritic score when we publish this at the end of the blogpost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rotate by PI because our 2D sprite is in the 3D world and we're rotating it in radians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Do you ever feel like a 2D sprite in a 3D world?
I know I do...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt="It moves!" class="align-center" src="/assets/images/seagl-2020/SeaGL-move-look.gif" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="step-4-eat-some-food"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 4: Eat some food! 🍔&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure we could all get _minutes_ of fun out of moving our seagl around the screen, but this game could really use something else...
Something tastier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's add burgers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will require us to do everything we just did, again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a Food Compnent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Burger entity with the food component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add an Eat system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register our Eat system with the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to add a food Component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add this component anywhere that feels right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#[derive(Default)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;pub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;impl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DenseVecStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;Self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's structurally identical to our Seagl, but with a different &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;struct&lt;/tt&gt; it's a totally different component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a Food component we can add our Burger entity.
Add this code to our &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;on_setup&lt;/tt&gt; function at the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;burger_sprite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SpriteRender&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sprite_sheet_handle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;clone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Transform&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set_translation_xyz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;75.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;75.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;create_entity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Food&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;burger_sprite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We create an entity spawning it at the point (75, 75, -1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spawn the burger at &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;z=-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to ensure the Seagl sprite is closer to the camera and thus is drawn on top of the burger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Have you ever seen a Seagull _behind_ a burger?
That's ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few exercises left to the reader:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you spawn multiple burgers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you re-spawn burgers when one is eaten?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you keep track of how many burgers were eaten?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you display the number of burgers eaten?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;I've only covered enough in this post to answer the first two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally an &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system's pseudocode looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;For each seagl with a location:
    For each Food with a location:
        If the Seagl overlaps with the Food:
            Destory that food
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit of a hack.
If this were a real game we would keep track of how many burgers the Seagl ate, but for this demo, we'll be lazy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;pub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;EatSystem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;impl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;EatSystem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SystemData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ReadStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ReadStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Seagl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ReadStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, we need to register this system with our game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did it.
We made a lil' game.
It had a Seagl and a burger.
And we had fun making it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't say it's &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; to make games in Rust, but we are &lt;em&gt;very far&lt;/em&gt; from having to write games from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Say you have a firewall restriction that creates the following situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App1 cannot communicate directly with App2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App1 and App2 can both talk to a Kubernets cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither app is hosted on the Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you get messages between App1 and App2?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the problem is stated makes it pretty obvious that the solution &lt;em&gt;involves&lt;/em&gt; using a Kubernetes cluster, but how exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The naive solution might be to spin up a container which acts as a proxy; Nginx comes to mind.
This would definitely work, but I am exceedingly lazy and don't want to learn how to configure Nginx.
In fact, the solution I came to doesn't involve running any new pods!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the code.
Below I'll explain what's happening here and why it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code yaml literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Endpoints&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;myapp-proxy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;subsets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;addresses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;ip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;2.3.4.5k&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# App2's address&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# App2's service port&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;v1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nn"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Service&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;targetPort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;v1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nn"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Ingress&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;paths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;serviceName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;myapp-proxy&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;servicePort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;extensions/v1beta1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="endpoints"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Endpoints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endpoints are the Kubernetes abstraction for IPs+Ports running the same application.
It's how you group together N instances of an app into one pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the hood Endpoints get created as a pre-requisite for every Service you deploy.
You don't usually need to deal with these directly as they are created implicitly whenever a Deployment gets applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By manually creating an endpoint we have imported our non-kubernetes app into Kubernetes.
That means we can do Kubernetes things with it like expose it via a Service or even put it behind an Ingress
Pretty neat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="service"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services are how we expose an endpoint to the world.
Most cloud providers will give you a public IP address for a service and load balance across all of that service's endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is as far as we need to proxy traffic between our two Apps.
App1 makes a request to whatever IP Kubernetes gets for the &lt;cite&gt;myapp-proxy&lt;/cite&gt; Service and relays it to the &lt;cite&gt;myapp-proxy&lt;/cite&gt; endpoint, which ultimately routes the traffic to App2.
What's really cool is that the endpoint that &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; App2 can be an self-hosted Virtual Machine, as long as the IP doesn't change this proxy will continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ingress"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ingress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingresses are my favorite part of Kubernetes.
They're very convenient, incredibly powerful, and they work like... over half the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not strictly necessary, this Ingress gives us some nice-to-haves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gives us an easy to manage host name via something like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-dns"&gt;External DNS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could be extended to terminate SSL, again &amp;quot;for free&amp;quot;, with something like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager"&gt;Cert Manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's how we use Kubernetes to manage services (lower-case 's') which aren't running in Pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So you want to set a node attribute in a resource block?
Good luck --
oh wait you don't need luck because you have this blogpost!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="problem"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are trying to set a node attribute in a resource block but it isn't working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example you have the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code ruby literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ruby_block&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'foo'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# some ruby&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;override&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'var'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'value'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;action&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:run&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'var'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'value'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;notifies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;some_resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;notifies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other_resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;whatever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though you're setting &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;node['var']&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;other_resource[whatever]&lt;/tt&gt; is getting notified to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;:run&lt;/tt&gt;.
What gives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To jump ahead, because you're skimming this post for the answer, you're going to want to do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code diff literal-block"&gt;
# go-go-gadget diffs
# Chef Version 13.5.8

  ruby_block 'foo' do
    block do
      # some ruby
      node.override['var'] = 'value'
    end
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;-   action :run
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+   action :nothing
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gd"&gt;- end
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+ end.run_action(:run)
&lt;/span&gt;
if node['var'] == 'value'
  notifies :run, some_resource[name]
else
  notifies :run, other_resource[whatever]
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically you want to execute the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ruby_block&lt;/tt&gt; that sets your attribute &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt; so the rest of your code can consume the value either later in the compilation phase or during the execution phase of the Chef run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-why-did-that-work"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How/why did that work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've read his far you're actually reading.
Welcome to the post!
Let's begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dig into &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what my problem was, because sometimes examples aren't good enough.
You know... for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to trigger an application upgrade based on the current installed version.
I was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; installing a package-manager-managed package &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id1"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; so I couldn't just pin the version a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;yum&lt;/tt&gt; resource, I had to do this kludge of a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for me &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;some_resource[name]&lt;/tt&gt; was downloading the latest version of the app (a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.tar.gz2&lt;/tt&gt; file from GitHub) and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;other_resource[whatever]&lt;/tt&gt; was a no-op.
The as part of the package download I unconditionally trigger a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;:delayed&lt;/tt&gt; service restart.
Chef was 'upgrading' and restarting my app every thirty minutes which broke core functionality. &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id2"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="shit-i-tried-before-stumbling-upon-the-solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shit I tried before stumbling upon the solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried a bunch of things, but they can all kinda be summed up in this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code diff literal-block"&gt;
# yay more diffs
  ruby_block 'foo' do
    block do
      # some ruby
      node.override['var'] = 'value'
    end
    notifies :create, 'tar[my-app]', :immediately # Triggers tar[my-app] to run now
  end

&lt;span class="gd"&gt;- if node['var'] == 'value'
-   notify :run, some_resource[name]
- else
-   notify :run, other_resource[whatever]
- end
&lt;/span&gt;
  tar 'my-app' do
    action  :nothing # Unless triggered this does nothing
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+   only_if { node['var'] == 'value' } # This should also do nothing if this isn't true
&lt;/span&gt;    # The rest of the resource block
  end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which ultimately didn't work either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I... I have no idea why this didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something something Chef is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-the-solution-works-and-the-other-stuff-didn-t"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why the solution works (and the other stuff didn't)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason my ultimate solution &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; work is best summed up by this quote from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.chef.io/resource_common.html#run-action"&gt;Chef Docs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Use &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;.run_action(:some_action)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at the end of a resource block to run the specified action during the compile phase.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My original code (read: broken code) was running the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; block during the compilation phase (happens earlier) and running the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ruby_block&lt;/tt&gt; in the execution phase (happens later).
By telling it to run my &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ruby_block&lt;/tt&gt; during the compilation phase we were ensuring it happened before the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; block, and in a way running it like you would 'expect' a script to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ain't idiomatic but it gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="errata"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Errata&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id3" rules="none"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label" /&gt;&lt;col /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="#id2"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The service was in question was Prometheus.
When Chef ran every 30 minutes, it killed the Prometheus process and thus killed all of our pending alerts.
TLDR we didn't get any alerts that took more than 30 minutes to trigger
We also &lt;em&gt;kept&lt;/em&gt; getting alerts that should taken a few hours to re-notify.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id4" rules="none"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label" /&gt;&lt;col /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="#id1"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Say that three times fast.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Fuck yes.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I checked my grades for the last time.
I can safely say that I have &lt;strong&gt;finally&lt;/strong&gt; gotten a gorramn undergraduate degree in Computer Science, with a minor in Mathematics, from Oregon State University. &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id2"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear that this happens on the reg &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; but I'm sure that every single person who &lt;em&gt;actually graduates&lt;/em&gt; feels amazing when they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not amazing because graduation is a Herculean feat.
I know I'm not a 60 year old grandmother who dreamt of getting a college degree for 45 years and finally scraped together the cash and time in retirement.
I'm also not a refugee that escaped a war-torn country for an education and a better life.
I'm just another white dude that checked all the boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't hard for me.
I just had to put my head down and do the work.
But it did take a long ass time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly my story is exactly like &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; college graduation stories.
I went to kindergarten, then elementary school, then middle school, then high school, then college, and now life.
I plugged away at school, did what I needed to pass my classes, stressed and lamented, studied hard and eventually the system said &amp;quot;Cool. You're done.&amp;quot;
Along the way I learned how to &amp;quot;play the game&amp;quot; &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;, albeit a bit late compared to a lot of my peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thankful to be in a field which doesn't require a masters or PHD to get a jorb.
Heck my field doesn't really require the degree I got; a surprising number of my friends got well paying jobs sans-degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also thankful to graduate without debt.
This came from some kickass parents + grandparents, some work during school, and some bad stuff that happened which ended up paying for abou half of my tuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thankful to graduate with wonderful friends, a job, and some passions which make my work-related decisions simple and profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, I'm thankful to be &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;.
Now I can finally focus on &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt;, my real passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm gonna have a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://10barrel.com/beer/crush-cucumber-sour/"&gt;Cucumber Sour&lt;/a&gt; and celebrate.
Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;School isn't really focused on making sure you &lt;em&gt;learned&lt;/em&gt;, it's mostly designed to make sure you can pass tests.
Once you figure this out you can focus on learning for the test instead of trying to grok the material.
I believe the kids call it a &amp;quot;life hack&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that you shouldn't try to grok the material, that just happens to take &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; longer than test-based learning.
So if you want a personal life, learn for the test; if you want a PHD, learn for the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;I didn't figure this system out until about Junior year of High School, too late to apply this zen skill to the ACT and SAT, but it was useful in college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;This is a part of a series of blog posts I wrote for an Independent Study on cryptography at Oregon State University.
To read all of the posts, check out the 'Independent Crypto' tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, is it over already?
It feels like we just started!
Those 10 weeks always fly by, and this term was no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent Crypto has been a thrill, an honor, and of course immensely educational.
It's been a blast to say the least.
The weekly check-ins with my mentor &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/"&gt;Mike Rosulek&lt;/a&gt;, forcing myself to engage with academic papers and online lectures, and finally having complex topics like Garbled Circuits and Elliptic Curves &amp;quot;make sense&amp;quot;, it was all very enjoyable.
I am very fortunate to have been given the opportunity to both create this course and take it.
Excited as I was before it began, it turned out even better than I could have hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's reflect on the some of the things we learned...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="elliptic-curve-cryptography"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Elliptic Curve Cryptography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned that Elliptic Curves look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="A straight forward ECC." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/independent-crypto/ecc-1.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="ECC with the line L illustrated." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/independent-crypto/ecc-3.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also learned that you can implement a version of the Diffie-hellman key exchange protocol by &amp;quot;adding&amp;quot; points on an Elliptic Curve over a finite field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also learned that despite how weird Elliptic Curve Cryptography sounds when you describe it, it can be used in very secure and efficient crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="memory-hard-functions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Memory Hard Functions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned that Memory Hard Functions (MHFs) are a solution to the arms race that is hash-cracking hardware.
Importantly, it relies on the fact that while there are specialized hashing processors, there is no specialized RAM for the same task (or any task really).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of an MHF is to make it as hard (or harder) for an adversary to compute a given hash as it was for you, assuming you're running on non-specialized hardware and they have specialized hash-cracking hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned that there are two types of MHF's: data-dependent and data-independent.
Data-dependent MFHs (dMHFs) have predictable memory usage patterns so they may be susceptible to cache-timing attacks.
Data-independent MHFs (iMHFs) are not susceptible to this attack as their memory patterns are not predictable.
While there are dMHFs in the wild, like scrypt which performs exceptionally well, there are not any any proven iMHFs in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also learned that this is what it looks like to &amp;quot;Pebble an iMHF Directed Acyclic Graph&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Animated DAG traversal." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/independent-crypto/dag-animated.gif" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also learned that the way to attack an iMHF is by performing a breadth-first search on the graph, then once you hit a wall, fill in the necessary nodes (pebbles) until you can compute the next node.
Much of the active research into iMHFs is in figuring out the best graphs, or types of graphs, to combat these kinds of feather/balloon attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="garbled-circuits"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Garbled Circuits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned that Garbled Circuits are a way of achieved two-party secure function evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice and Bob agree on a circuit (program) to garble.
One party encrypts the circuit by encrypting each logic-gate.
Both parties obfuscate their inputs and evaluate the garbled circuit.
This gives both parties the result of the original program without either party knowing the exact inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't a fool-proof security measure.
Sometimes it is good to ask the party garbling said circuits to create a few extras.
The evaluating party opens some of them to make sure they're on the up-and-up.
The other party evaluates the remaining circuits and verifies that the outputs are consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also learned that this game is surprisingly fun for only having &lt;strong&gt;four levels&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="garbled-circuits-game.html" height="400px" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;Permalink: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://elijahcaine.me/garbled-circuits-game.html"&gt;http://elijahcaine.me/garbled-circuits-game.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="remote-timing-attacks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remote Timing Attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now for something completely different!
We broke from the math and theory to focus on a problem involving real tangible bits!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on response timing differences an adversary can sometimes determine private information &lt;strong&gt;like your OpenSSL Private Keys&lt;/strong&gt;.
This is scary, but the problem has mostly been fixed and now there are standards the crypto community follows to write code which is secure against these attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're writing crypto and you know what you're doing, make sure you're using the defacto constant-time libraries for bit-wise comparisons, mathematical operations, and pretty much anything involving secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="miscellaneous"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally gained a lot from this course.
I wrote annotated bibliographies, read academic papers, implemented a remote timing attack, and made a fun little game which was totally relevant and 100% not just an excuse to play around making games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite sinking hours into this course I barely scratched the surface of every topic.
I've got &lt;em&gt;loads&lt;/em&gt; more I could cover if I was inclined to do so.
I'm not saying I'm &lt;em&gt;going&lt;/em&gt; to get a graduate degree, but if it's anything like this I'd be up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;This is a part of a series of blog posts I wrote for an Independent Study on cryptography at Oregon State University.
To read all of the posts, check out the 'Independent Crypto' tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fade in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a Linux system administrator.
You and thousands of other admins are running OpenSSL on you battle tested Linux servers.
You trust that your data is transfered securely from host to host because... why wouldn't it be?!
OpenSSL makes things secure.
Duh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months into running that server you figure out that your private keys have been compromised!
They were stolen somehow but you can't figure out what happened.
You check the logs to see if somebody hacked into your system, but nothing obvious catches your eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combing through the logs you do see an IP address that tried (and failed) hundreds of thousands of times to authenticate with your OpenSSL server.
It attempted authentication over and over and failed relentlessly until suddenly, after about two days, it stopped.
Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later you read an academic paper from Stanford. &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id24" id="id1"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;
It clicks.
You've you've been Remote Timing Attacked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="definition"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote Timing Attacks are a special brand of Side Channel Attack where adversaries use differences in response times to determine private information.
Creepy I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of code and Statistics&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; goes into figuring out secret information based on this, but let's start small.
Take the following comparison which lives in a hypothetical SSL library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;recieved_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;KeyLengthError&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;recieved_key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;expected_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Thing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UnknownKeyError&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might seem innocent enough but as it turns out this leaks information!
The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; operator does not &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; take the same amount of time to return a response.
In fact, this operator tends to compare two inputs bit-by-bit.
When it finds a difference it short-circuits and returns True or False.
If &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;recieved_key&lt;/tt&gt; shares the first N bits with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;expected_key&lt;/tt&gt;, the program will return slightly sooner than if they only shared the first N-1 bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the timing difference if it's just returning one or two cycles earlier; does it really matter?
As it turns out, there is &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; of a difference to break security and enable an adversary to decrypt entire private keys! &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id24" id="id2"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;
This is put well by an article on chosenplaintext.ca: &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id25" id="id3"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now, it may not seem significant that an attacker can see how many bytes of their key were a match, but it can actually be &lt;strong&gt;fatal&lt;/strong&gt; to security.
The attacker can crack the first byte of the key by trying all 256 possibilities, and observing which one caused the comparison to take longer.
Now, armed with the first byte, they can do the same with the second byte, and the third, and so on, until they have recovered the entire key.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a lot of patience an adversary can recover secret information from an OpenSSL processes on the same host OS, an OpenSSL processes on a Virtual Machine on the same host OS, and even an OpenSSL on a separate host processes across a network.
It gets harder (read: more time consuming) to hack the farther away adversary, but they're all possible with sufficient patience, compute power, and Statistics&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="oh-god-fix-it-please"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oh god fix it please&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clam down!
We've come a long way since 2003 when this was proven to be a viable attack.
Most SSL libraries have fixed this vulnerability so you're fine as long as you updated in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;haven't&lt;/em&gt; updated in the past decade... burn that server.
Even the silicon atoms are compromised.
It's not even worth trying a fresh install.
The thing is just too far gone, start fresh.
Goodnight, sweet prince.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="constant-time-algorithms"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Constant-time Algorithms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did the crypto libraries solve this problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Constant-time Algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh fancy, tell me more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constant-time Algorithms are a way of implementing an algorithm in a way that always takes the same amount of time to compute regardless of the input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, these perform in constant-time while processing &lt;em&gt;secret&lt;/em&gt; information.
This distinction means processing a secret key &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; takes N cycles while checking that a configuration file is correctly formatted might take a M cycles or maybe M+5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of coding practices to be aware of in crypto which help us to avoid leaking information for Remote Timing Attacks.
Let's go over a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="limit-conditionals-on-secrets"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Limit conditionals on secrets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Avoid conditioning on secret information to avoid (among other things) CPU branch predictions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take this code for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;usually_true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;do_usual_thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Path A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;do_weird_thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Path B&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CPU eventually will recognize that Path A is going to happen more than Path B so it will try to optimize for that path, making the &amp;quot;usual thing&amp;quot; faster.
This makes sense from a CPU designer standpoint &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id27" id="id4"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;, but it leaks information about which branch is being taken.
When the &amp;quot;unusual thing&amp;quot; happens the CPU has to backpedal before continuing, which takes a notable amount of time.
This backpedaling gives an adversary enough information to craft an attack the path they're on and extrapolate secret information based on that path-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This type of attack (conditioning on private information) is explored in the Constnat Time Algorithm example and Remote Timing Attack demo near the end of the post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="division-multiplication-tricky-stuff"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Division/Multiplication: tricky stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Multiplication is not always constant-time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take this piece of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code text literal-block"&gt;
t1_a = current_time
small_number_a * small_number_b
t2_a = current_time

t1_b = current_time
big_number_a * big_number_b
t2_b = current_time

assert(t2_a - t1_a == t2_b - t1_b)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, even though the first and second blocks are just multiplying two numbers together they can take different amounts of time depending on your CPU and compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is triggered by some CPUs just not being equipped to handle large numbers, so they have to perform the large number multiplication in software.
Other CPUs optimize for small numbers since those get handled more frequently than large numbers.
These are pretty old hardware limitations, and the issue has mostly been resolved in newer 64-bit CPUs.
That said... you know... still something to lookout for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for division.
Many CPUs don't have hardware support for division so the compiler needs to handle the operation in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLDR: the same piece of code which is constant-time on one architecture (X86_64) might not be constant-time on another piece of hardware (x86_32 for example). &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id22" id="id5"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="compilers-and-undefined-behavior"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compilers and undefined behavior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Watch out for compiler's &amp;quot;undefined behavior&amp;quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C programming language, and &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; programming languages, have a formal specification of some kind.
This formal specification gives the programmer a good idea about what their code will do when they compile and run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example if I wrote the following C:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code c literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; run and return &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;30&lt;/tt&gt;, because the specification tells us that the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; operator adds two numbers and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; returns a given value from a function.
It also says that &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; returns a given integer as the exit status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I ran that code and it returned &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; I'd be very confused; that breaks specification!
Compiler authors know this and follow the specification of the C language very carefully to make sure specified inputs produce specified outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about behavior the specification &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; mention?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take for instance this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code c literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;fprintf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;%d&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;214748300&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;214745000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might not be explicitly covered by the specification because it's pretty weird.
214748300 and 214745000 are close to the signed integer maximum, so when multiplied together what happens?
Will the program print an unsigned integer value of 4611686014132420609 or does it return a signed integer which has overflowed but is still signed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind headache is called Undefined Behavior and it basically means the compiler, or rather the compiler's authors, &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; which behavior they think is best because the language spec didn't say what should happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another side effect hinted at is that while you can be confident what the end behavior of your code will be you can't predict how that behavior is achieved.
This didn't used to be an issue when C compilers were just 1:1 mapping your C loops and functions to sane assembly.
Fortunately compilers have gotten much better at producing fast and efficient executables.
&lt;strong&gt;Unfortunately&lt;/strong&gt;, we aren't easily able to predict the runtime of our code because our compilers are liable to pour some black-magic voodoo on any and all binaries it produces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These points are condensed really well by the BearSSL website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The C programming language is defined to run in an abstract machine under the &amp;quot;as if&amp;quot; rule, so the compiler is free to translate your code in any sequence of instructions that yield the expected result, with execution time not being part of the observable elements that must be preserved.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we know that a function will always &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;, the C language (and compiler spec) doesn't care about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it gets done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're trying to write crypto code this can feel like you're a parent telling your kid to clean their room.
They'll make it look clean, but they just shoved everything under the bed.
Technically they did what you wanted, the room looks cleaner, but they missed the point.
Something about building character in constant-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we do?
We need to trick the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a handful of tricks to &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id26" id="id6"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; to get the compiler to (a) avoid unknown behavior and (b) enforce a specific assembly output.
These are tricks include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a bit-wise operations instead of the equivalent mathematical operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark important [secret] variables as volatile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manually zero out important [secret filled] memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use multiple sources of entropy; as many as you can get your hands on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the output assembly and become a Jedi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are very high-level solutions to some of the problems, solutions I'm only going to hand-wavily describe, but honestly that's because I don't really grok the solutions and don't want to lead you astray.
Check out the end of this post for further reading by really smart people that get paid to do this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-can-t-i-just"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;quot;Why can't I just...&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt;?
If only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the first thought I had (and every other crypto novice has) is something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code text literal-block"&gt;
do time sensitive operation
sleep N seconds
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't work because this just shifts the amount of time it takes to do an operation, literally &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; making your crypto take longer.
Then the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; thought I and every other crypto novice has is something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code text literal-block"&gt;
record start time
do time sensitive operation
record end time
sleep (expected time - elapsed time) seconds
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; but you'll never &lt;em&gt;nail&lt;/em&gt; the expected time.
It'll either be too long or too short
This means that either some amount of information is leaked, when &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;expected time&lt;/tt&gt; is too short, or the crypto is needlessly slow, which is just a silly compromise. &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id25" id="id7"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; make it algorithmically secure without this &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sleep&lt;/tt&gt; hack, so we &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="practical-solutions-to-timing-attacks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practical Solutions to Timing Attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're implementing crypto, STOP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're implementing crypto and you know what you're doing, your language of choice &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; has a constant-time library which implements some primitives that you can take advantage of for simple tasks like comparisons.
Those can be found at the end of this post in Errata. &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#ctlibs" id="id8"&gt;[CTLibs]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking into constant-time-ifying your code, do some reading and testing!
There have been a lot of developments in analyzing program constant-time-ness and much of this work is Open Source!
These are implemented using a lot of Statistics&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, code inspection, and even Valgrind. &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id31" id="id9"&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id28" id="id10"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id32" id="id11"&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt;
If you're really concerned that &lt;em&gt;Your Crypto Library&lt;/em&gt; isn't secure against Remote Timing Attacks, take one of those tools on a test drive and see what happens.
It's pretty likely that you'll find a &lt;em&gt;notable&lt;/em&gt; timing difference based on different inputs and you'll probably need to make changes for your library to be secure against timing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's for the greater good.
Because of your contributions the crypto community is even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-crazy-idea-constant-time-language-spec"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A crazy idea: constant time language spec&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My crazy idea, for my &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; hypothetical grad-school studies would be to implement a Constant-time &lt;em&gt;compiler&lt;/em&gt; and/or &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt;.
This would perform transformations to your code in an attempt to make it constant-time or warning you when your code isn't going to run in constant-time when it ought to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this would take a very long time, and honestly I haven't thought it through entirely, but I imagine something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code text literal-block"&gt;
regular code

ct {
    thing that needs to be constant-time.
}

regular code
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where you tell the compiler &amp;quot;This needs to be constant-time&amp;quot;.
The compiler does it's best to convert loops and statements into constant-time and when it's done it tells you if it was able to convert your code into constant-time execution or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's probably overkill; you don't usually just willy-nilly write constant-time code.
That said, just like C and Python help produce less error prone code than writing straight Assembly, so too might a constant-time language help produce code that hits less of the tricky pitfalls of implementing Constant-time algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="constant-time-algorithm-example"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Constant-time Algorithm example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take our code block from the beginning, the one that did the leaky comparison.
That takes different amounts of time when processing a given key against a known private key.
How would we write &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; in constant-time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Short circuit based on user input, does not leak private information&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;recieved_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;KeyLengthError&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;recvied_bits&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;recieved_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Taken to be constant-time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;expected_bits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;expected_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Taken to be constant-time&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;ret&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Thing&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;recieved_bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;expected_bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ret&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;KeyLengthError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This sets the output, but the loop does not break&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ret&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to our original code but it does a few things differently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We convert our keys to a variable which can be operated on bit-wise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We manually compare each bit of the inputs. This is what the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; operator does, but instead of returning when we get a difference we essentially set a switch. &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ret = Error&lt;/tt&gt; from &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ret = Thing&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outside of the loop we return our response after processing all of our bits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally this is almost identical to our original code, but it does not return earlier or later depending on the user's input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another implementation avoids the direct comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Short circuit based on user input, does not leak private information&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;recieved_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;KeyLengthError&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;recvied_bits&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;recieved_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Taken to be constant-time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;expected_bits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;expected_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Taken to be constant-time&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;matching_bits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;matching_bits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;recieved_bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;expected_bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;matching_bits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;thing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;KeyLengthError&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="remote-timing-attack-demo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remote Timing Attack demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Examples are fine, but what about a demo!
You said this was a real threat!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, I did say that... so we'll do a small demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a bit of Python code that checks a user's input against some hard-coded secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# secret.py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Used to exaggerate time difference.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Used to read user input.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;is_equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Custom `==` operator&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Fail if the strings aren't the right length&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Short-circuit if the strings don't match&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This exaggerates it just enough for our purposes&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Hard-coded secret globals FOR DEMONSTRATIONS ONLY&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;secret&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'l33t'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This is python for &amp;quot;If someone uses you as a script, do this&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'__main__'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The user got it right!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is_equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'You got the secret!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The user got it wrong&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Try again!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The user forgot to enter a guess.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;IndexError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Usage: python secret.py yourguess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; \
             &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'The secret may consist of characters in [a-z0-9] '&lt;/span&gt;\
             &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'and is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; characters long.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that makes the above code particularly useful for our purposes is that it exaggerates the time it takes to evaluate the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;is_equal&lt;/tt&gt; function.
Think of this as the 'backpedaling' the CPU does... turned up to 11.
Most important [for the author] we don't need to use Statistics&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; to figure the secret, evaluating each input multiple times and collecting/processing that timing data, it already takes about one magnitude longer to evaluate a matching letter than it does to evaluate a non-matching letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we've got the attack code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# attack.py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Used to get a timing difference.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ascii_lowercase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# All lowercase characters&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# All digits as strings&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# used to exec a secret.py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;devnull&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Suppress output of secret.py&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'aaaa'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Initial guess&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a bit convoluted in parts but if you stare at it for a while and read the enlightening comments you should see why this gets the right answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to copy that code into two files, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;secret.py&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;attack.py&lt;/tt&gt; and run it like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code text literal-block"&gt;
$ time python attack.py
character 0 is l
character 1 is 3
character 2 is 3
character 3 is t
Final guess is l33t

real  0m35.176s
user  0m1.300s
sys 0m0.485s

$ python secret.py l33t
You got the secret!
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll need a working Python installation and probably a shell of some kind.
I'm on CentOS Linux but any *nix system will &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; work.
With some fiddling you can probably get it to work on Windows ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This isn't a real threat!
You exaggerated the problem!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hush now.
It demonstrates the principles of the attack.
Besides, the post is over.
We've only got time for the conclusion and then you're off to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="constant-time-blogpost"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Constant-time blogpost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic has been a break from the theory/math-heavy term thus far.
Honestly I'm jazzed about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned that something as small as a comparison (a &lt;em&gt;comparison&lt;/em&gt;!) can leak information to an adversary.
Your algorithm might be secure, but if you're not careful you can leak information in the most menial code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't a lost cause.
We don't need to throw this &lt;em&gt;security&lt;/em&gt; thing out the window.
If we're aware of the gotchas we can craft code that solves these problems.
It's hard work but the peace of mind should make it worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning about this seemingly obscure (&lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt;) exploit in algorithmically secure code is just the kind of headache I enjoy in Computer Science.
Although I don't feel like I did Remote Timing Attacks justice, I could probably spend weeks on it, I had to call it quits.
I could keep working on this for &lt;em&gt;another 10 weeks&lt;/em&gt;, but it's over.
Just walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;BearSSL is a project which aims to make an architecture-independent constant-time implementation of various Crypto Libraries, largely mirroring compatibility with OpenSSL and related Open Source crypro libraries.
Not only is the project interesting but a handful of blogposts and analysis are posted on the website covering topics like how to implement RSA in constant-time to the compatibility of various CPU models with assumptions about constant-time operations (e.g., multiplication).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Remote Timing Attacks are Practical &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id24" id="id14"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This paper was very easy to read for an academic article and covered the creation of various timing attacks in practical conditions (e.g., hacking an RSA private key across a network).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Beginner focused blogs &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id25" id="id15"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id16"&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;These were two blogposts which laid out what timing attack, why they were viable, and how you can avoid them.
Protip: never assume a library you're using is constant-time.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Adam Langley's blog &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id30" id="id17"&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id32" id="id18"&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Adam Langley has great Intermediate-level blogposts about the Lucky13 attack and analyzing code for constant-time execution.
These aren't for the weak of heart, but are much more accessible than a lot of academic articles on similar topics.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;This wiki outlines some common pitfalls when writing constant-time code and how to avoid it.
It assumes you're writing C code, but many of the principles carry to more exotic languages.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;These academic papers outline tools developed for studying how constant-time a program is and analyzes various programs with these tools.
They're a great (surprisingly recent) survey of this topic.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;This is a part of a series of blog posts I wrote for an Independent Study on cryptography at Oregon State University.

&lt;p&gt;Let's imagine you are a billionaire.
You want to know if you have more money than your billionaire friend Bob, but for some reason it's &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; faux pas to let anybody how much money you have, even your good friend Bob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you're a billionaire!
You're not used to the phrase &amp;quot;that isn't possible&amp;quot;.
In your frustration you try to figure out if you can use some of your billions to find a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first solution you come up with is Trusty Tina.
You tell Tina how much you make, Bob tells Tina how much he makes, and then Tina tells both of you who makes more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that Tina isn't &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; trustworthy, her parent's just named her that.
Like... you wouldn't trust her with your life or anything.
You could pay her to keep your assets secret but Bob might pay her a bit more reveal your number to him.
Tina reminds you of this so you have to pay her &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; to keep the secret, and eventually you have an arms-race type situation at hand.
With your cunning accountant skills you can already tell that Tina might be more trouble than she's worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you won't tell Bob directly, and you can't depend on Manipulative Tina, is there &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; way to determine out who has more money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="party-secure-function-evaluation"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2-Party Secure Function Evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem above is the Millionaires problem &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id20" id="id1"&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; and it is solved by the use of 2-party secure function evaluation (SFE).
The general idea &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id18" id="id2"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; is that you have a function &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; which takes as input &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt;.
This function is garbled by one of the two parties into &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;f'&lt;/tt&gt; and the inputs are garbled into &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;x'&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;y'&lt;/tt&gt; by each of the parties.
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;f'(x',&lt;/span&gt; y') == f(x,y)&lt;/tt&gt; but does not leak any of the inputs, because &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt; were obfuscated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice and Bob agree on a function (i.e., circuit) &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;f(a,b)&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice garbles the function (&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; circuit) &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; and her input &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice sends &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;f'&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;a'&lt;/tt&gt; to Bob.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob gets his input &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt; garbled into &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;b'&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob evaluates &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;f'(a',&lt;/span&gt; b')&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This reveals the result of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;f(a,b)&lt;/tt&gt; to Bob, but does not reveal Alice's input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half of this post focuses on honest garbled circuit uses, meaning both parties are acting honestly (and don't pull any fast-ones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;The latter portion focuses on problems with that 'vanilla' garbled circuit implementation and potential solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="garbling-a-gate"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Garbling a gate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Alice actually... 'garble' a circuit?
It sounds kinda dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each gate (OR, AND, XOR, etc) has two inputs.
Sick with me.
Each input is encrypted.
Keeping up?
So you need a &lt;em&gt;key&lt;/em&gt; to use &lt;em&gt;each gate&lt;/em&gt;.
It gets better.
But if you have the keys, you don't know which key corresponds with a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; or a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; so you can compute a function without knowing the actual values you put in.
Whoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's use the OR gate as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember truth-tables for OR?
Here's a reminder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="45%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="27%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="27%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead valign="bottom"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class="head"&gt;OR&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;0&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This table is going to be important for Alice's part of this dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="alice-s-circuit-input"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alice's circuit &amp;amp; input&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice definitely does the heavy lifting in this transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice generates 4 keys &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Kx0&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Kx1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Ky0&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Ky1&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice creates four variables corresponding with the four values in the OR table:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="19%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="41%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="41%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead valign="bottom"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class="head"&gt;OR&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;0&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;B00&lt;/tt&gt; = 0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;B01&lt;/tt&gt; = 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;B10&lt;/tt&gt; = 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;B11&lt;/tt&gt; = 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each box is encrypted with the two keys:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="11%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="43%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="46%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead valign="bottom"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class="head"&gt;OR&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;0&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;E(Kx0||Ky0,&lt;/span&gt; B00)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;E(Kx0||Ky1,&lt;/span&gt; B01)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;E(Kx1||Ky0,&lt;/span&gt; B10)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;E(Kx1||Ky1,&lt;/span&gt; B11)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice sends these ciphertexts (unordered) to Bob.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bob-s-input"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bob's input&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob gets Alice's input, key &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;KxA&lt;/tt&gt;, from Alice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob uses oblivious transfer &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id19" id="id3"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; to get his input &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;KyB&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With these two keys Bob is able to process the circuit (an OR gate).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob has enough information to get one of the four possible outputs of the circuit, but doesn't know if Alice's input is a 1 or a 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, while Bob can share the output of the circuit, he should &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; share his input.
That would make using OT (step 6) obtuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="last"&gt;The UTF-8 Padlock symbol doesn't render on my browser because I seem to have gone back in the time to the late 90s.
Being stuck in the past, we have to comprmise.
The ⛨ symbol is meant to represent a lock and the ⚿ represents a key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple gates can be connected together to build more complicated circuits.
One important difference is that while each intermediate circuit still has four cipher-texts, for the four outcomes of a truth-table, those decrypt to a &lt;em&gt;key&lt;/em&gt; and not a 1 or 0.
The only gates which decrypt to a plain-text of 0 or 1 are output gates, not the intermediate gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="problems-with-garbled-circuits"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problems with garbled circuits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few important flaws in the &lt;em&gt;security&lt;/em&gt; of garbled circuits as they have been described.
The first is that although Alice and Bob agree on a circuit to garble there is no guarantee that the circuit one is evaluating (if you're Bob) is the circuit you agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice and Bob 'agree' on a function &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;f(a,b)&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice creates her own function &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;g(a,b)&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice garbles &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;g&lt;/tt&gt; and her input &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; and sends it to Bob as &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;f'&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;a'&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob evaluates &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;g'(a',b')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and reveals the output to Alice. Alice now knows something other than than Bob agreed to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="improvements-on-garbled-circuit-security"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improvements on garbled circuit security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent the above adversarial attack we do something called &amp;quot;Cut-and-Choose&amp;quot;.
This is when Bob checks Alice's work to make sure she's not cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that Alice and Bob agreed on a given circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice generates M garbled circuits for the agreed upon function where M &amp;gt; 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All secrets for a randomly chosen N circuits are revealed where 1 ≤ N &amp;lt; M, the circuits are &amp;quot;opened&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob selects one of the remaining M-N circuits to evaluate as outlined earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ensures that Alice is not nefarious to some statistical certainty.
She had control over how the circuits were garbled but she does not have control over which are revealed or evaluated.
If she made one (or two or three...) nefarious circuits that bad behavior is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; revealed in step 2, if all the checked circuits are good Alice is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; being honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't break garbled circuits for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While Alice reveals the secrets of the N circuits, she doesn't reveal anything about her input. We are only un-garbling the circuit not the inputs (revealing all possible inputs, not Alice's).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're not un-garbling the M-N circuits which may be evaluated, so those are still secret.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As M grows and N approaches M this method gets more secure at the cost of computation cycles and bandwidth in transferring the garbled circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-free-xor-optimization"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The &amp;quot;Free XOR&amp;quot; Optimization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm definitely not a circuits person.
You can show me a circuit diagram and I'll say &amp;quot;Yep, that's a circuit. What's it do?&amp;quot;
I couldn't even even identify which gate is which without Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was told during my research for this post that XOR gates are very popular with garbled circuit design, and more broadly circuit design in general.
This was shared to me in the form of a cryptic hint so I figured I'd investigate and share my findings here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out the Wikipedia page notes that this XOR optimization exists and even cites the original paper published on the topic. &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id15" id="id4"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jist of this optimization is that one can very efficiently garble an XOR gate such that the output of the gate is encoded as the XOR of the keys used to unlock the gate and some known global constant.
This is in contrast with the implementations discussed in the beginning where each gate had to be decrypted with two cipher-texts and revealed another key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically using XOR, which is pretty fast, we can avoid generating four keys per gate and instead craft 1 key which is produced as the result of 'unlocking' a gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put a bit more formally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a gate G with input wires A and B and output wire C and a random string R, the garbled gate is obtained by XORing the garbled gates inputs C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = C&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ⊕ R:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = A&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ⊕ B&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = (A&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ⊕ R ) ⊕ (B&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ⊕ R) = A&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ⊕ B&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = C&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ⊕ R = A&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (B&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ⊕ R ) = A&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ⊕ B&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = (A&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ⊕ R) ⊕ B&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = A&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ⊕ B&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;LETTER&lt;sup&gt;{0,1}&lt;/sup&gt; is short-hand for the True or False output of the given gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't super intuitive, and honestly I just put those equations up there to prove that I read a paper about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main takeaway is that 'free XOR' saves us computation generating and processing cryptographic keys by simply performing the XOR operation.
This optimization is so powerful that using &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; XOR gates makes garbled circuits notably faster and more useful for secure computation. &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id17" id="id5"&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;This is by far the most thorough academic source I have.
If I had a better foundation in academic reading this might be the perfect paper but most of it went way over my head.
That said the overview of each section was fairly human-readable and gave me a good rough overview for many of the topics covered in this post.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A Brief History of Practical Garbled Circuits &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id17" id="id7"&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;This was the first source I checked out to get a feel for how difficult garbled circuits are as a topic.
It quickly glanced at the basics of garbled circuits and then quickly went into the optimizations on garbled circuits.
This was overwhelming, but as I started to learn more about garbled circuits and filled in the knowledge gaps it gained significant value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;It's a great talk about Garbled Circuits which wasn't ideal for beginners, but did give me a good breadth of the topic and what I could dive into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Improved garbled Circuit: Free XOR Gates and Applications &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id15" id="id8"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This paper was useful in giving me an academic preview of the XOR optimization in Garbled Circuits.
I quickly started looking at the many other papers referenced by this one, kind of like following down the Wikipedia wormhole, but with more PDFs and less pictures.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;SFE: Yao's Garbled Circuit &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id12" id="id9"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This slide-deck was very useful as a reference for basic GCs and securing GC's with cut-and-choose.
It wasn't a great initial source for this material, but it was useful &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; I had a basic understanding of a topic to solidify it with pretty pictures and Comic Sans.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Mike Rosulek on Stack Exchange &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id14" id="id10"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id16" id="id11"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This is more of a shout-out than a citation.
Mike Rosulek's posts on crypto.stackexchange.com were very helpful in breaking down core concepts like what garbled circuits are and why XOR is &amp;quot;free&amp;quot;.
They also provided a good list of further reading which was helpful in addition to the resources provided in the syllabus.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice sends two possible options to a box labeled OT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob sends a choice to the box labeled OT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob gets back one of the two options, without knowledge of the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice does not know which option Bob got.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;This is a cryptographic primitive which is very useful for tasks like generating Bob's input to the garbled circuit &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;f'&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

This post adjusts the scenario for inflation.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;!-- garbled circuits are kinda like monads.
When everybody hears about them they write a blogpost (paper) explaining them in their own unique 'intuitive' way. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Honestly, Yao got out of this pretty easy.
He said "Here's a thing, but I'm just gonna say it, not prove it" and everybody was like "Oh shit that could be a thing."
If he was wrong somebody would just say "Oh that's not really a thing." and inevitably *not* publish because that's boring.
If he's right (he is) he's like Euler; jotting things down in the margins for other people to prove.
At least that's the story I'm reading. --&gt;

&lt;p class="last"&gt;This is a part of a series of blog posts I wrote for an Independent Study on cryptography at Oregon State University.

&lt;div class="section" id="problem-storing-passwords-is-hard"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem: storing passwords is hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're a system administrator and -- oh no!
A hacker stole your database!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not yet... but they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;.
Once you get popular enough it's bound to happen. &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id19" id="id1"&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;
Can you make sure your users data is safe &lt;strong&gt;when&lt;/strong&gt; that happens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you store passwords in a database you never store them in plain text.
Instead, you store a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function"&gt;hash&lt;/a&gt; of that password.
For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
Password: 12345678
sha256sum (hash): 2634c3097f98e36865f0c572009c4ffd73316bc8b88ccfe8d196af35f46e2394
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hash is generated when the user tries to login.
The &lt;em&gt;hash&lt;/em&gt; of the password the user sends at login is compared against the corresponding password hash for that user.
If it matches that means the user sent the right password and so they are authenticated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if the hacker pre-computes a bunch of popular passwords?
This might sound crazy, but there are lots of people that re-use passwords, like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;123456&lt;/tt&gt;.
The hacker can pre-compute the hash for the 1,000,000 most popular passwords and more or less reverse-search for any user's password once they have a database dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="solution-1-add-salt"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution 1: add salt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first naive solution to solve this problem is to make the adversary's life harder by adding &lt;em&gt;salt&lt;/em&gt; to our passwords.
This is a piece of known information which is added to the password so adversaries can't pre-compute a hash-table, they have to compute this after they have the database and figure out the salt.
For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
Password: 12345678
Salt: cryptoHeckYeah!
New Password: 12345678cryptoHeckYeah!
sha256sum: 6e8a7780df48a0b687e9e272e8d082f5f4c0c3a8c43b63461c3f62618b111e9d
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we live in 2017 and Graphics processors and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit"&gt;ASICs&lt;/a&gt; are cheap and can compute sha256sums &lt;strong&gt;super fast&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;really cheap&lt;/strong&gt;.
This means that it might be more of a pain, but the adversary can still crack a password with relative ease and efficiency because they've got a computer &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; to generate lots of hashes.
Curses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="solution-2-h-h-h-x"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution 2: H(H(..H(x)..)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computing a single sha256sum is easy, but what if the hacker had to compute like... 1000 sha256sums for each password!
That sounds pretty hard... right?
If we compute the hash of the hash of the hash (etc) it would take like... 1000x longer to compute each user's password.
Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
p = '12345678cryptoHeckYeah!'
for x in 1..1000
  p = sha256sum( p )
end
return p

Result: 47c76630def739ede9c05fd974065b1200d4712aa2421eefb1f6b241a1ca6bea
Time: 0m1.547s
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this hurts more than it helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In bash on non-specialized hardware, this took about 1.6 seconds.
On specialized hardware, written in a systems programming language, and implemented in parallel it'd be much less costly for an adversary to crack passwords hashed this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, this is &lt;em&gt;easier for an adversary to compute than it is for the the &amp;quot;good guys&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; because the non-malicious actor is using generalized hardware and the adversary is using specialized hardware to compute the hashes.
It's like trying to beat a Roadster in a drag race when you're behind the wheel of a Minivan; the Minivan (&amp;quot;good guys&amp;quot;) &lt;em&gt;can't win&lt;/em&gt; because they weren't built for drag races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="solution-3-memory-hard-functions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution 3: Memory Hard Functions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big problem we have is that CPUs can be specialized to crack passwords &lt;em&gt;very quickly&lt;/em&gt;.
No matter how fast your AWS EC2 instance is, or even that top of the line IBM server you just bought, it will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be faster than a cheap custom designed ASIC.
At around 3000$/box it won't break the adversary's bank to break into yours. &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id20" id="id2"&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there specialized hash-cracking CPUs &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; exist, specialized hash-cracking &lt;em&gt;memory&lt;/em&gt; does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; exist. &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id17" id="id3"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;
If we were to create an algorithm which depends on lots of memory, instead of lots of CPU cycles, we could &amp;quot;level the playing field&amp;quot;.
This should help stop adversaries from reversing passwords as fast as they currently can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theoretical hash-function is called a Memory Hard Function (MHF).
These are difficult to perform unless you have a certain threshold of memory.
As a result non-malicious actors can perform a hash in M seconds and it will take a malicious actor &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; M seconds to perform the same hash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;TLDR: We want a hash function that takes as long for an adversary to compute as it does for the &amp;quot;good guys&amp;quot; to compute.
Since nobody has specialized hash-cracking RAM we should be able to create a hash function which is memory-intensive and fits our criteria.
If we have a function that fits this we will have got a &lt;em&gt;Memory hard Function&lt;/em&gt; (MHF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="scrypt-a-wild-mhf"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;scrypt: a wild MHF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scrpyt is a key derivation function &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html"&gt;developed for the Tarsnap project&lt;/a&gt;.
It was designed explicitly to solve this problem and has some pretty impressive results.
Some especially impressive results include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scrypt is about 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; times more expensive to attack for logins than bcrypt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scrypt is about 2&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; times more espensive to attack for logins than MD5 CRYPT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scrypt is about 2&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; times more expensive to attack for file encryption than MD5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scrypt also happens to be a MHF.
Yay we found one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a hash function H, an input B, and an integer N, compute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = H&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;(B), given 0 ≤ i &amp;lt; N,&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
X = H&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;(B)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then iterate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;j &amp;lt;- Integrify(X) mod N&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X &amp;lt;- H(X ⊕ V&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N times; and output X&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function Integrify can be any bijection &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id18" id="id4"&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt; from {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; to {0...2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; - 1}.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking that down a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The function is given a different hash function (H), an input to compute the hash of (B), and a modulus (N).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N hashes are generated with variations of H and the input B called V&lt;sub&gt;0..N&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X is initialized with a hash value and a loop begins:&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;j is set to a psuedo-random integer mod N.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X is set to the hash of the existing X value xor'd with one of the V values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop N times and output the final X.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest gripes with scrypt is that it has a very predictable runtime.
This means that the running of the function is predictable based on the user's input and so can be victim to a cache-timing side-channel attack.
We won't be able to get into what this attack means, but basically you can say &amp;quot;scrypt is good, but not perfect&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="data-independent-mhfs-imhfs"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data-independent MHFs (iMHFs)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="A directed acyclic graph map." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/independent-crypto/DAG.gif" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iMHFs are supposed to solve the problem that scrypt has (side-channel attacks) by have unpredictable runtimes which still result in the same output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iMHFs can be thought of as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) which are traversed during runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some specifics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The function depends on a random oracle H: {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;2k&lt;/sup&gt; -&amp;gt; {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The function provides a Directed Acyclic Graph Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) G used to encode data-dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The initial input is a password and a salt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each other node is labeled with the hash of it's parent nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The output is the hash of the value of the last node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, a very nice feature of iMHFs is that their memory usage pattern does not depend on the user's input (password) and so is not vulnerable to side-channel attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pebbling-a-directed-acyclic-graph-dag"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pebbling a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="A directed acyclic graph traversal." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/independent-crypto/dag-animated.gif" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can think of the process of computing the output of an iMHF as pebbling a graph where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computing the value of a node is to pebble it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are rules about which nodes can be pebbled at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a pebble is removed from a node it is freed from memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our goal is to pebble the last node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can only place a pebble on a node if we have pebbles on all of it's parents nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our goal is to get to the sink node (exit node).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The naive pebbling algorithm, the one the 'good guy' user would utilize is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only one pebble can be placed per time-step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The graph is pebbled in in topological order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pebbles (calculated nodes) are never discarded until the end of the function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expected cost: scales with n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where n is the number of nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does take up considerable resources, but it isn't prohibitive for users on commodity hardware.
This means it won't take &lt;em&gt;too long&lt;/em&gt; to get your account authenticated.
More importantly, it will take about as long for the bad guys to calculate a token as it took you to calculate a token, as opposed to a small fraction it would take if this was a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; hash function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="attacks-on-imhfs"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attacks on iMHFs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attack is defined as when cost of calculating a hash from an iMHF is lower than via the nieve approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea of an iMHF attack is that it has two phases: light phase and balloon phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="light-phase"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Light Phase&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the light phase the algorithm races through the DAG discarding as many pebbles as possible, essentially performing a breadth first search for the end of the graph, computing nodes in parallel when possible.
Once a node is computed and it isn't immediately needed it is discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the DAG were a straight line from beginning to end this would be fairly memory efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="balloon-phase"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Balloon Phase&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the balloon phase the algorithm has 'hit a wall' and back-computes the nodes it needs to compute the next node whose parent's have already been discarded.
This causes a slow-down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attack described like this has the following complexity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
E&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;(A) = O(en + √(n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;d))&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For small values of e and d this results in an attack as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
E&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;(A) = O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for e,d = O(n)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preventing against this type of attack is where much of the research into iMHF's is focused.
An ideal iMHF DAG minimize the disparity between the attackers compute time and the &amp;quot;good guy's&amp;quot; compute time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a rough overview of Memory Hard functions, how they work, and how variations of MHFs differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MHFs are functions which remove the advantage that adversaries have to crack passwords by depending heavily on memory.
This reduces the adversary's advantage if they have an ASIC or GPU processor(s) to brute-force a password crack and ought to make it very difficult (ideally &lt;em&gt;impractical&lt;/em&gt;) for adversaries to crack a password hashed with an MHF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some existing MHFs, like scrypt, are vulnerable to side-channel attacks so iMHFs have been theorized which do not have a predictable runtime and so are not vulnerable to side-channel attacks.
No iMHFs exist yet, however many functions have been developed with get &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; and offer many of the benefits of iMFHs.
Some of these include Argon2i, Catena, and Balloon hashing, which we did not cover in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The three videos cited in this post cover largely the same content and present the material, including the problem, naive solution, MHF solution, iMFH solution, and possible attacks against iMHFs in about 30 minutes.
I like to think I'm pretty good at public speaking, but this material was very complicated and presented in a very digestible format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;This was the soul reference for the scrypt section of this post.
There is an academic paper published too, but the slides were simple and presented all of the same knowledge (I think) sans any proofs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;If I feel an existential hole in my heart I might read the proofs, but in the interest of time I chose not to right now.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;This is a part of a series of blog posts I wrote for an Independent Study on cryptography at Oregon State University.
To read all of the posts, check out the 'Independent Crypto' tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition warning"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;This post is jumps around a bit.
We'll start by showing how Elliptic Curve Cryptography works at a high level, then create a list of questions about how/why Elliptic Curve Cryptography works and how it is useful to cryptogrpahy.
Once those questions are answered we will end with a recap.
Hopefully we will zero in on what Elliptic Curves are and what Elliptic Curve Cryptography is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="diffie-hellman-key-exchange"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diffie-Hellman key exchange ++&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You find yourself day-dreaming during a walk around campus wondering if there is an alternative cryptography system to the very popular RSA.
You want something that has improved computational and network efficiency.
You want smaller keys that are harder to crack.
Could such a system exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You share this fantasy with a friend, you share all of your crypto fantasies with this friend, and they tell you that Elliptic Curve Cryptography is promising and it perfectly fits your needs.
... but how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="diffie-hellman-key-exchange-a-recap"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Diffie-Hellman key exchange (a recap)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a useful crypto out of Elliptic Curves we need to implement &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange"&gt;Diffie–Hellman key exchange&lt;/a&gt; (DHKE).
Once we have DHKE we more or less have a valid crypto system which we can build upon to encrypt and decrypt private information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader (you) is assumed to be familiar with DHKE.
While DHKE is fairly simple, it is not unforgettable, so here is quick reminder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice and Bob agree on a public modulus (p) and a base (g).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice and Bob both choose secret integers (a and b).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice sends Bob g&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; (mod p) (we call it A) and Bob sends Alice g&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; (mod p) (we call it B).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice computes B&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; (mod p) and Bob computes A&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; (mod p). These are equivalent (mod p). This is Alice and Bob's shared secret.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we use Elliptic Curves get a similar 'shared secret'?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="elliptic-diffie-hellman-key-exchange"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Elliptic Diffie-Hellman key exchange&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a (very) high level the algorithm is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice and Bob agree to use a given Elliptic Curve over a finite field, E(F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), and a public point P ∈ E(F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice chooses a secret integer n&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and Bob choose secret integers n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice computes Q&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = n&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;P and Bob computes Q&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;P. These are the &amp;quot;Public Keys&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice sends Bob her public key, Bob send Alice his public key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice computes n&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, Bob computes n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The shared secret value is n&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = n&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;P) = n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;(n&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;P) = n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks similar to the given DHKE algorithm, and seems promising, but... how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ecs-and-ecc-q-a"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Elliptic Curves and Elliptic Curve Cryptography Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer that we are going to answer the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are Elliptic Curves?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does an Elliptic Curve look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean to multiply P by n?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about a finite field?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are the pubic keys used? Why are these a shared secret?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is Elliptic Curve Cryptography useful?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-are-ecs"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are Elliptic Curves?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Elliptic Curve is the set of solutions to an equation of the form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = X&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + AX + B&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-does-an-ec-look-like"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What does an Elliptic Curve look like?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two examples of Elliptic Curves are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="A simple Elliptic Curve" class="align-center" src="/assets/images/independent-crypto/ecc-1.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Another simple Elliptic Curve" class="align-center" src="/assets/images/independent-crypto/ecc-2.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="adding-p-and-q"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding P and Q&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiplication is &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; repeated addition.
Oh shoot we haven't said how &amp;quot;addition&amp;quot; happens on an Elliptic Curve.
Let's do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addition is the process of drawing a line L between P and Q.
The third point that the line L intersects is point R.
When R is reflected over the X axis we call this R'.
The result of P ⊕ Q (read: P 'plus' Q) is R'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can enumerate these steps as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take two points P and Q on the Elliptic Curve E.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw a line L which passes through these two points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L should ultimately pass through &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; points: P, Q, and R.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiply the Y coordinate of R by -1, this is R'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P ⊕ Q = R'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a visualization of straight forward addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Annotated curve E with points P, Q, R, R' and line L labeled." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/independent-crypto/ecc-3.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think &amp;quot;What happens when P is tangent a point on E?&amp;quot;
In that case we say P = Q, so R = P ⊕ P, or R = 2P.
It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Annotated curve E with points P, R, R' and line L labeled. P is tangent to the curve." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/independent-crypto/ecc-4.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a second, 2P looks like n*P which was one of the questions we had!
Don't worry, we'll get there soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="that-thing-about-finite-fields"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;That thing about Finite Fields&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice we bound the curve over a field F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; with p ≥ 3.
We input {1, 2, ..., p-1} as the value of X in E and select the results which are squares modulo 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;E : Y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = X&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 3X + 8 over F&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;X = 1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;1 + 3 + 8 = 12&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;12 is a square (mod 13)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeating this gives us the set of points in E(F&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
E(F&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;) = {O, (1,5), (1,8), (2,3), (2,10), (9,6), (9,7), (12,2), (12,11)}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice this bounds the graph of E and forces us to draw a strange modulus graph shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Elliptic Curves illustrated where each point is a valid coordinate. There are no curves." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/independent-crypto/ecc-5.gif" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="multiplying-p-by-an-integer-with-the-double-and-add-algorithm"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multiplying P by an integer with The Double-and-Add Algorithm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To &amp;quot;multiply&amp;quot; P by n we need to use the Double-and-Add Algorithm.
Here's how that looks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="0"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a point P ∈ E(F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) and an integer n ≥ 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Q = P and R = O.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop while n &amp;gt; 0.&lt;ol class="arabic" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If n ≡ 1 (mod 2), set R = R + Q&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Q = 2Q and n = floor(n/2).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return the point R, which equals nP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recall that the algorithm for finding point 2Q was covered in the above section&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="reference internal" href="#adding-p-and-q"&gt;Adding P and Q&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-is-the-shared-secret"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the shared secret?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's review.
The shared secret is the second point n&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;P, which is a point on the public curve E(F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;).
This point can be used to encrypt information as it is a shared secret (necessary for DHKE).
How exactly it is used to encrypt information is left as an exercise for readers in charge of cryptographic implementation standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this is a shared secret is because an adversary needs to solve the following Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
nP = Q&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is a very hard problem, as mentioned in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="an-example-of-ecc"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An example of Elliptic Curve Cryptography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds good in theory, but let's give it a test drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice and Bob are given the following shared information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;p = 3851, E: Y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = X&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 324X + 1287, P = (920, 303) ∈ E(F&lt;sub&gt;3851&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice and Bob choose their secret integers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 1194&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 1759&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice and Bob then compute their public keys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Alice computes Q&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 1194P = (2067, 2178) ∈ E(F&lt;sub&gt;3851&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Bob computes Q&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 1759P = (3684, 3125) ∈ E(F&lt;sub&gt;3851&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Remember that we use the Double-and-Add algorithm to compute Q&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and Q&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;.
This invloves iteratively computing the tangent line at a point, the intersection with E at that intersection, and reflecting that point over the X axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice and Bob trade public keys and calculate their shared secret:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Alice computes n&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 1194(3684, 3125) = (3347, 1242) ∈ E(F&lt;sub&gt;3851&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Bob computes n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 1759(2067, 2178) = (3347, 1242) ∈ E(F&lt;sub&gt;3851&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore (3347, 1242) is the shared secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-ecc-is-useful"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Elliptic Curve Cryptography is useful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is harder than simply multiplying mod p for Alice to compute her shared secret (which is the case in RSA), it is &lt;em&gt;even harder&lt;/em&gt; for a malicious actor to figure out that same shared secret.
This point is best put by the source &lt;em&gt;A (relatively easy to understand) primer on elliptic curve cryptography&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You can compute how much energy is needed to break a cryptographic algorithm and compare that with how much water that energy could boil.
This is a kind of a cryptographic carbon footprint.
By this measure, breaking a 228-bit RSA key requires less energy than it takes to boil a teaspoon of water.
Comparatively, breaking a 228-bit elliptic curve key requires enough energy to boil all the water on earth.
For this level of security with RSA, you'd need a key with 2,380 bits.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So an Elliptic Curve Cryptography key can be one magnitude smaller in size and offer the same level of security as RSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can put this in more concrete terms: the fastest algorithm to solve the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem, which Elliptic DHKE security is built upon, in E(F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) takes √p steps.
This is much more difficult than the 'vanilla' Discrete Logarithm Problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="notes-and-edge-cases"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes and edge cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliptic Curve Cryptography, much like the rest of Cryptography, deals heavily with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory"&gt;Number Theory&lt;/a&gt;.
Despite my best efforts most of the nitty-gritty Number Theory in this topic went &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; over my head.
As a result I didn't include much of that kind of stuff and instead focused on the things I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; share and sound smart about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some other things about Elliptic Curve Cryptography I didn't cover that deserve more air time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Elliptic Curve chosen must meet a special set of criteria; any old Elliptic Curve won't do. This was the cause of a cryptographic breach with Elliptic Curve Cryptography a few years ago that triggered doubts about Elliptic Curve Cryptography as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some primes cause solving the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem for E(F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) to be easier than the Discrete Logarithm Problem, these primes can be computed and should be avoided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want a deeper understanding of the theory of Elliptic Curves (addition of points on these curves, etc) you should look into &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry"&gt;algebraic geometry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="annotated-bibliography"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annotated Bibliography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The chapter in this textbook on Elliptic Curves in Cryptography established the bedrock understanding of the topic of Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
This ended up being the main resource for this post and offered a great median between &amp;quot;Regular Joe's guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The graduate student's guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography&amp;quot; which were my other two resources.
It was also the source of all examples, which were very useful in gaining an intuitive understanding of the material.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A (relatively easy to understand) primer on elliptic curve cryptography &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id4"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This blog post was my &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; source and did a good job of taking the proofs and dense material in Intro to Math Cyrpto (above) and boiled it down to the important stuff.
It drastically improved further readings of the original textbook and provided that great animated image of adding P ⊕ Q in E(F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;).
It didn't cover any of the Number Theory, but explained the historical context of Elliptic Curve Cryptography, roughly how/why it works, and did a good job of describing it's impact in our world today.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Cryptography: An Introduction &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id5"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This wasn't a resource I actually &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt;, but I did read the chapter on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (chapter 2!).
It gave me an appreciation for the previous two sources and some exposure to the other ways Elliptic Curves can be taught.&lt;/dd&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;This is a part of a series of blog posts I wrote for an Independent Study on cryptography at Oregon State University.
To read all of the posts, check out the 'Independent Crypto' tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition warning"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;This syllabus was written by an Oregon State University undergraduate student and not by an Oregon State University staff member.
This should explain any irregularities in the structure and substance of the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this course (&amp;quot;Independent Crypto&amp;quot;) is to give students an opportunity to dive deeper into interesting topics of Cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this course you should &lt;em&gt;grok&lt;/em&gt; the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elliptic curve cryptography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory hard functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garbled circuits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An topic of your choosing (get creative!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these should take about 40 hours of work to complete.
An overview of what that means is outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is designed to be a 4 credit hour independent study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;As is standard Oregon State University policy, this corresponds with 160 hours of work over a 10 week period.
Plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each topic ought to take about 40 hours of work to complete over the course of a 10 week term.
If you schedule your time well this will be a piece of cake at just 16 hours per week.
That's 2.28 hours per day, 3.2 hours per week-day, or 16 hours the day before your check-in is due!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic structure is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research a topic. Read papers, watch informative videos, ask questions and learn as much as you can about a given topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain an &lt;em&gt;annotated bibliography&lt;/em&gt;. This should include materials found while studying a given topic, a summary of each of the materials, and a final summary of the topic as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meet weekly with the mentoring professor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;???&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end goal, in addition to learning about a breadth of topics in modern security, is to produce an annotated bibliography.
This will exercise the student's ability to read and process academic topics, journals, and videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course if you are particularly passionate about a topic you are encouraged to go further: implementing things of interest, investigating new questions, and generally 'digging deeper' as you gain interest in different topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following topics do not &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be completed in order, however doing so will result in an optimal 'difficulty curve' as the kids say.
The kids do still say that right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Included are a few resources grabbed in a quick internet search.
These are meant to be starting places for each topic, generating questions and providing external resources.
You will need to find additional resources for each topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Preamble&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm learning Kubernetes (K8s) for work and decided to try my hand at deploying Buildbot with K8s because we all know the universal law discovered made by Science McSmartyPants in the 1758 which stated: &lt;strong&gt;doing cool shit &amp;gt; reading docs&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#docs-should" id="id1"&gt;[docs-should]&lt;/a&gt;.
I would describe K8s and Buildbot, but they each already did that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Buildbot is an open-source framework for automating software build, test, and release processes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that still didn't make sense, don't worry you should keep reading.
This is a fun post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; As you read this post keep in mind: &lt;em&gt;it might walk like a tutorial, quack like a tutorial, and even read like a tutorial, but I promise you that it is in fact&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;a tutorial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This post is an adventure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="squad-goals"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Squad Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick rundown of what I want to achieve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy an instance of Buildbot on K8s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have that instance scale it's number of workers automagically depending on the amount of work being asked of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share all relevant storage between replicated containers (e.g., databases, builds, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never deployed Buildbot ever for anything.
I have also not really worked with K8s until starting my recent jorb at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://coreos.com"&gt;CoreOS&lt;/a&gt;.
Why Buildbot and why K8s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have to learn K8s sooner or later for work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to deploy something a little more complicated than Nginx.
As fun as that is, every K8s tutorial uses that as an example and it's getting &lt;em&gt;oooooold&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Buildbot seems like a good K8s challenge b/c:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;ol class="first last loweralpha"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has 3 moving parts (master, worker, database)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could benefit from the fancy-dancy auto-scaling features built into K8s (e.g., high workload -&amp;gt; add more workers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-sick-rig"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My sick rig&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using the latest version of K8s and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#minikube"&gt;Minikube&lt;/a&gt;, which is backed by Virtualbox on a 2014 MacBook Pro running OSX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minikube version and associated OS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ minikube version
minikube version: v0.13.1
$ minikube ssh
...
Boot2Docker version 1.11.1, build master : 901340f - Fri Jul  1 22:52:19 UTC 2016
Docker version 1.11.1, build 5604cbe
docker&amp;#64;minikube:~$
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's some Minikube-specific semantics in this post, but you can probably get by with whatever K8s back-end you want/have lying around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl version
Client Version: version.Info{Major:&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, Minor:&amp;quot;4&amp;quot;, GitVersion:&amp;quot;v1.4.6&amp;quot;, GitCommit:&amp;quot;e569a27d02001e343cb68086bc06d47804f62af6&amp;quot;, GitTreeState:&amp;quot;clean&amp;quot;, BuildDate:&amp;quot;2016-11-12T05:22:15Z&amp;quot;, GoVersion:&amp;quot;go1.7.1&amp;quot;, Compiler:&amp;quot;gc&amp;quot;, Platform:&amp;quot;darwin/amd64&amp;quot;}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, Minor:&amp;quot;4&amp;quot;, GitVersion:&amp;quot;v1.4.6&amp;quot;, GitCommit:&amp;quot;e569a27d02001e343cb68086bc06d47804f62af6&amp;quot;, GitTreeState:&amp;quot;clean&amp;quot;, BuildDate:&amp;quot;1970-01-01T00:00:00Z&amp;quot;, GoVersion:&amp;quot;go1.7.1&amp;quot;, Compiler:&amp;quot;gc&amp;quot;, Platform:&amp;quot;linux/amd64&amp;quot;}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between finishing editing and pushing this post the above versions will probably be out of date.
&lt;em&gt;SHRUG&lt;/em&gt;.
What are you gonna do.
Software, amirite?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtualbox version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ virtualbox --help
Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager 5.1.6
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSX Version and hardware:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ sw_vers
ProductName:    Mac OS X
ProductVersion: 10.10.5
BuildVersion:   14F1912
$ system_profiler
...
    Hardware Overview:
      Model Name: MacBook Pro
      Model Identifier: MacBookPro11,1
      Processor Name: Intel Core i5
      Processor Speed: 2.6 GHz
      Number of Processors: 1
      Total Number of Cores: 2
      ...
      Memory: 16 GB
      ...
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardware and Virtualbox versions are a little less important, but might as well be included for completeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="first-pass"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First Pass&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buildbot project is nice enough to provide &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.buildbot.net/current/tutorial/docker.html"&gt;some Buidlbot Docker infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; to start working with.
It uses a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/"&gt;Docker Compose&lt;/a&gt; YAML file to deploy one worker container, one master service, and one PostgreSQL service, each of which is linked together and &lt;em&gt;just works™&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great!
In theory &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#theory-vs-practice" id="id2"&gt;[theory-vs-practice]&lt;/a&gt; we can just translate the options in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to K8s options to get a simple cluster up and running.
Which, to clarify, isn't an established &lt;strong&gt;thing&lt;/strong&gt;, it's just a process I'm guessing should work based on the fact that Docker Compose  and K8s are both orchestration tools.
One is &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; more complicated and robust, but At least &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; of their features should over-lap in that Venn diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we've got a nieve translated-docker-compose k8s setup running then we can (hopefully) tweak some knobs and get persistent storage and auto-scaling working &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#id11" id="id3"&gt;[why]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="throw-some-containers-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Throw some containers at the wall and see what sticks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start really basic and just try to get something running with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;kubectl run&lt;/tt&gt;.
We'll use K8s to deploy a Buildbot &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master&lt;/tt&gt; container mentioned in that &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; with translated configuration options from that file.
Remember, we're just mapping a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; into a K8s setup to begin.
Nothing fancy, no pre-emptive optimizations, just this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl run master \
    --image=buildbot/buildbot-master:master \
    --env=&amp;quot;BUILDBOT_CONFIG_DIR=config&amp;quot; \
    --env=&amp;quot;BUILDBOT_CONFIG_URL=https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot-docker-example-config/archive/master.tar.gz&amp;quot; \
    --env=&amp;quot;BUILDBOT_WORKER_PORT=9989&amp;quot; \
    --env=&amp;quot;BUILDBOT_WEB_URL=http://localhost:8080/&amp;quot; \
    --env=&amp;quot;BUILDBOT_WEB_PORT=8080&amp;quot; \
    --port=8080
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reading later and I can tell you that command started a &lt;em&gt;Deployment&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Pods&lt;/em&gt;.
To see if it worked, let's run &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;kubect get pods&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                               READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
master-4259088255-afsfk            1/1       Running            1          10s
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks pretty good...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                               READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
master-4259088255-afsfk            0/1       CrashLoopBackOff   2          1m
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... nooo!
The thing was at 1/1 and now it's at 0/1 &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; it says &lt;strong&gt;CrashLoopBackOff&lt;/strong&gt;.
Numbers going down when they're supposed to stay the same is never a good sign, and crashing is almost never what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I've learned &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; about fixing stuff that's broke it's &lt;em&gt;always check the logs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl logs po/master-4259088255-afsfk

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross, but probably useful. How? Good question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw the word &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;database&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; deploy a database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;QED let's do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="add-one-cup-of-postgres-to-the-mix"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Add one cup of Postgres to the mix&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like with the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master&lt;/tt&gt; container, we're just going to use CLI arguments to get a database running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl run postgres \
    --image=postgres:9.4\
    --env=&amp;quot;POSTGRES_PASSWORD=change_me&amp;quot; \
    --env=&amp;quot;POSTGRES_USER=buildbot&amp;quot; \
    --env=&amp;quot;POSTGRES_DB=buildbot&amp;quot; \
    --env=&amp;quot;BUILDBOT_DB_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://{POSTGRES_USER}:{POSTGRES_PASSWORD}&amp;#64;db/{POSTGRES_DB}&amp;quot;\
    --port=5432
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross fingers aaand...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                               READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
master-4259088255-afsfk            0/1       CrashLoopBackOff   6          9m
postgres-2443857112-3ermh          0/1       ContainerCreating  0          15s
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;/me holds breath&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                               READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
master-4259088255-afsfk            0/1       CrashLoopBackOff   6          9m
postgres-2443857112-3ermh          1/1       Running            0          54s
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuss! Wait, for real?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl logs postgres-2443857112-3ermh
[... hey look a bunch of useful Postgres garbage ...]
PostgreSQL init process complete; ready for start up.
[... some more useful Postgres garbage ...]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good 'nuff.
Now how does this database plug into the master container?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in the Docker Compose world, containers talked to one-another on a private network with the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;link&lt;/tt&gt; directive.
There's probably some way to do we do that with K8s right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="welcome-yaml-config-files-to-the-class"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Welcome YAML config files to the class&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running Command-Line Interface (CLI) commands is fun, but the easiest way to get this system running seems to be with configuration files.
I'm sure I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; use CLI commands to orchestrate this entire project, but... honestly all the tutorials talk about how to do things in YAML so we're doing it in YAML now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some research later it looks like declaring a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pods/"&gt;Pod&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go?
For context, here's where I got the idea from the K8s docs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers (such as Docker containers), the shared storage for those containers, and options about how to run the containers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that sounds &lt;em&gt;roughly&lt;/em&gt; like what we're doing.
I've got some containers, I want them to be able to talk to each other, and they're all logically connected to one another.
Let's go down this rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://wifflegif.com/gifs/272040-alice-in-wonderland-adventure-time-gif"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alice down the rabbit hole..." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/buildbot-on-k8s/alice-down.gif" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I have Frankensteined this config &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;buildbot.yaml&lt;/tt&gt; from examples in the configs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code yaml literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'v1'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Pod'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'buildbot'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;labels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'buildbot'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;containers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'master'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'buildbot/buildbot-master:master'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;containerPort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'BUILDBOT_CONFIG_DIR'&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'change_me'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'POSTGRES_USER'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'buildbot'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'POSTGRES_DB'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'buildbot'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'BUILDBOT_DB_URL'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'postgresql+psycopg2://{POSTGRES_USER}:{POSTGRES_PASSWORD}&amp;#64;db/{POSTGRES_DB}'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when we run it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well first we need to clean up that CLI-created garbage we were doing earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl delete deployment master postgres
deployment &amp;quot;master&amp;quot; deleted
deployment &amp;quot;postgres&amp;quot; deleted
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then deploy the new pod:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl create -f buildbot.yaml
pod &amp;quot;buildbot&amp;quot; created
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaaand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl get pods
buildbot   2/2       Running   0          23s
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm suspicious...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl logs po/buildbot master
checking basedir

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whelp let's play 'Where do I fix &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Is the problem in:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;ol class="first last loweralpha simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;buildbot-master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;postgres&lt;/tt&gt; image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;buildbot.yml&lt;/tt&gt; file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you guessed &lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt; you would be right so let's start in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;buildbot.yaml&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience with databases, specifically the startup time of database containers like Postgres and MariaDB, I'd &lt;em&gt;guess&lt;/em&gt; that the database was taking too long to start.
After some digging around, I found out that Pods were the entirely wrong way to go.
Here's how that discovery went:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Does K8s have anything like docker-compose's &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;depends_on:&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay, so how... actually, is there anything like what I'm doing already out there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: ... Where?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/examples/mysql-wordpress-pd"&gt;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/examples/mysql-wordpress-pd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Noice. So the &lt;em&gt;Pods&lt;/em&gt; thing was the wrong rabbit hole to go down?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: Right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Right like correct or right like...?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: Stop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="yay-examples"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Yay examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's run that example to make sure it all works fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cd&lt;/tt&gt; to example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow README instructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl create -f local-volumes.yaml
persistentvolume &amp;quot;local-pv-1&amp;quot; created
persistentvolume &amp;quot;local-pv-2&amp;quot; created
$ kubectl create -f mysql-deployment.yaml

$ kubectl create -f wordpress-deployment.yaml
service &amp;quot;wordpress&amp;quot; created
persistentvolumeclaim &amp;quot;wp-pv-claim&amp;quot; created
deployment &amp;quot;wordpress&amp;quot; created
$ kubectl get all

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I can go to the site?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Wordpress working correctly." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/buildbot-on-k8s/wordpress-working.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="now-use-the-example"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Now Use the example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to morph &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;wordpress-deployment.yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; into &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;postgres.yaml&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;wordpress-deployment.yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; into &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master.yaml&lt;/tt&gt;
Also, let's ignore &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;local-volumes.yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; for now, just to be safe.
Don't forget: we're not doing anything fancy yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master.yaml&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code yaml literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;v1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Service&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Recreate&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;labels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;buildbot&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with a flick of my wand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl delete pods,deployment,service --all  # cleanup the old stuff
pod &amp;quot;buildbot&amp;quot; deleted

&lt;p&gt;Opens up this wonderful site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Buildbot working." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/buildbot-on-k8s/buildbot-working.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, they can talk &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#same-app-note" id="id4"&gt;[same-app-note]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hire-a-worker"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hire a worker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we've got a website and a database, but we're not actually running any builds yet.
Let's fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on what the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; says we should be able to throw this together and have it work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;worker.yaml&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code yaml literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;v1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Service&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;worker&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;labels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;buildbot&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khaaaaaan!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="connection-issues"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Connection issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine, let's get to work debugging.
First we'll login to the worker pod and try to ping the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;buildbot&lt;/tt&gt; pod since the output makes it seem like there was a timeout between the host and the worker.
This usually means they can't reach each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl exec -it worker-3607067131-qdpfd bash
buildbot&amp;#64;worker-3607067131-qdpfd:/buildbot$ ping master
bash: ping: command not found
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uhh...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
buildbot&amp;#64;worker-3607067131-ke4zb:/buildbot$ curl http://master:8080
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;[... definitely actually a webpage ...]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the worker can reach the master, but can the master reach the worker?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl get pods -l tier=master
NAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
master-2152810066-9ip8b              1/1       Running   0          21m
$ kubectl exec -it master-2152810066-9ip8b sh
/var/lib/buildbot # ping worker
PING worker (172.17.0.6): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.17.0.6: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.083 ms

^C
--- worker ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.083/0.092/0.101 ms
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so they can connect to one-another.
What's the problem then?
My best guess is that the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master&lt;/tt&gt; pod needs to have it's special worker port (&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;9989&lt;/tt&gt;) exposed.
So let's add those lines to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master.yaml&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code diff literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;--- a/blogpost/updated-master.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+++ b/blogpost/updated-master.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gu"&gt;&amp;#64;&amp;#64; -8,6 +8,8 &amp;#64;&amp;#64; spec:
&lt;/span&gt;   ports:
     - port: 8080
       name: frontend
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+    - port: 9989
+      name: worker
&lt;/span&gt;   selector:
     app: buildbot
     tier: master
&lt;span class="gu"&gt;&amp;#64;&amp;#64; -55,3 +57,5 &amp;#64;&amp;#64; spec:
&lt;/span&gt;         ports:
         - containerPort: 8080
           name: frontend
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+        - containerPort: 9989
+          name: worker&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after tearing everything down and bringing it back up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl get pods -l tier=worker
NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

How does the front-end look?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl get pods -l tier=master
NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
master-3038604518-jim6q            1/1       Running   0          2m
$ kubectl port-forward master-3038604518-jim6q 8080
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in a browser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Buildbot still working." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/buildbot-on-k8s/build-success.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may now do a happy dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Happy Dance .gif" class="align-center" src="/assets/images/buildbot-on-k8s/happy-dance.gif" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="storage"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Storage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got the three core moving parts of our system, next on our list is adding some persistent storage.
Thankfully, we can recycle the MySQL+Wordpress example we used before.
Yay examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's add the storage bits back in that we ignored before. This results in configs that look like so (abbreviated for your scrollbar's convenience):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;volumes.yaml&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code yaml literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;v1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;PersistentVolume&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;local-pv-1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;labels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;capacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;1Gi&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;accessModes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;ReadWriteOnce&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of lastly we edit the Buildbot &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master.cfg&lt;/tt&gt; to use our custom paths for storing and carrying out builds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code diff literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;diff --git a/blogpost/volumes-master.cfg b/blogpost/volumes-master.cfg

&lt;span class="gd"&gt;-      factory=factory))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+      factory=factory,
+      builddir='builds',
+      workerbuilddir='builds'))
&lt;/span&gt;
 ####### STATUS TARGETS
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just an edited version of the original &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master.cfg&lt;/tt&gt; you can find in the original Buildbot docker-compose example repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; just work, right?
We request a volume of a given size, the volume exists and is the correct size, badda bing badda boom, do the thing like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl delete service,deployment,pods --all
service &amp;quot;master&amp;quot; deleted
service &amp;quot;postgres&amp;quot; deleted
service &amp;quot;worker&amp;quot; deleted
service &amp;quot;kubernetes&amp;quot; deleted
deployment &amp;quot;master&amp;quot; deleted
deployment &amp;quot;postgres&amp;quot; deleted
deployment &amp;quot;worker&amp;quot; deleted
$ kubectl create -f volumes.yaml
persistentvolume &amp;quot;local-pv-1&amp;quot; created
persistentvolume &amp;quot;local-pv-2&amp;quot; created
persistentvolume &amp;quot;local-pv-3&amp;quot; created
$ kubectl create -f postgres.yaml
service &amp;quot;postgres&amp;quot; created
persistentvolumeclaim &amp;quot;postgres-pv-claim&amp;quot; created
deployment &amp;quot;postgres&amp;quot; created
$ kubectl create -f master.yaml
service &amp;quot;master&amp;quot; created
persistentvolumeclaim &amp;quot;master-pv-claim&amp;quot; created
deployment &amp;quot;master&amp;quot; created
$ kubectl create -f worker.yaml
service &amp;quot;-worker&amp;quot; created
persistentvolumeclaim &amp;quot;worker-pv-claim&amp;quot; created
deployment &amp;quot;worker&amp;quot; created
$ kubectl get pods -l tier=master
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
master-3176013930-gvy2i   1/1       Running   0          1m
$ kubectl port-forward master-3176013930-gvy2i 8080
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -&amp;gt; 8080
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -&amp;gt; 8080
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kinda works, but it kept getting weird arbitrary errors which looked suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Permissions fail in buildbot" class="align-center" src="/assets/images/buildbot-on-k8s/permissions-build-fail.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the only thing that had really changed was the volumes I figured I might as well login to the host and investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ minikube ssh
docker&amp;#64;minikube:~$ ls -alh /data/
total 20
drwxr-xr-x    5 root     root        4.0K Dec 11 02:21 ./
drwxr-xr-x    6 root     root        4.0K Dec 11 01:48 ../
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root        4.0K Dec 11 02:20 pv-1/
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root        4.0K Dec 11 02:33 pv-2/
drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root        4.0K Dec 11 02:33 pv-3/
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahah!
That's the problem, root owns everything but the builds are run by the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;buildbot&lt;/tt&gt; user (&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;uid: 1000&lt;/tt&gt;)
&lt;em&gt;/me shakes fist at permissions errors.&lt;/em&gt;
The last first place you think to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is there any way to change the permissions of a volume as you claim it (i.e., in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;volumes.yaml&lt;/tt&gt;)?
We can both go through this journey together or I can share with you a quote from my coworker Barak Michener, the BAMF that works on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coreos/torus"&gt;Torus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barak Michener&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;yeah, hostPath is completely hands-off from k8s perspective&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;so you just chmod the underlying dir&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;to whatever uid you're using inside the pod&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out the problem was with my &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;type&lt;/tt&gt; of storage in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;volumes.yaml&lt;/tt&gt;.
As of yet there is no type-agnostic way to assign permissions for mounted volumes.
Storage, why you gotta be like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after digging around and asking Barak I finally concluded that I had to had to login to my host and set the correct permissions on the directories being reserved.
Here's how you do that on Minikube:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ minikube ssh
docker&amp;#64;minikube$ sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /data/pv*
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case we could just chown the one volume that's going to be used by the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;worker&lt;/tt&gt; pod, since the other ones run their services as &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;root&lt;/tt&gt;, but much like Debra from accounting, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;root&lt;/tt&gt; doesn't give a fuck.
Might as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we try the build again with the correct permissions, what happens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Buildbot with permissions fixed." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/buildbot-on-k8s/build-success-perms.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huzah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="autoscaling"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Autoscaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last we have what I suspect will be the &lt;em&gt;hardest&lt;/em&gt; part of the project: autoscaling.
Here's what we want in a perfect world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a lot of builds get requested, spin up more &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;worker&lt;/tt&gt; nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When fewer builds are requested, destroy those extra &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;worker&lt;/tt&gt; nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="asking-the-question"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Asking the question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This task is actually a pretty tough cookie to crack.
We want enough workers to each deal with 1/N requests in a queue of N builds, essentially scaling the building service to deal with usage spikes.
It sounds straight forward enough, but how do we test it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="creating-a-test-case"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating a test-case&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this we need to add a few projects to our instance of Buildbot, each of which will have a hefty workload.
To do this we need to host a Buildbot &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master.cfg&lt;/tt&gt; config file at some public location and refer to this in the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master.yaml&lt;/tt&gt; config file.
I used the GitHub repo that accompanies this blogpost &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#accompanying-repo" id="id5"&gt;[accompanying-repo]&lt;/a&gt;, but you could use GitHub Gists or a pastebin; just make sure you're referring to the &lt;strong&gt;raw&lt;/strong&gt; file or a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.tar.gz&lt;/tt&gt; with the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master.cfg&lt;/tt&gt; file at the base of the tarball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's pull a project out of a hat that takes a while to build, how about... &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo"&gt;Cargo&lt;/a&gt;.
Any objections?
Great, let's roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started we'll need a custom &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;worker&lt;/tt&gt; container can build Cargo.
A small adventure later and we have this Dockerfile which has all of the dependencies to build what we want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
FROM buildbot/buildbot-worker:master

RUN echo 'PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.cargo/bin' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $HOME/.bashrc

RUN apt install -y cmake pkg-config

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set this to auto-build on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://quay.io/"&gt;quay.io&lt;/a&gt;, hosted at the docker-pull url &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;quay.io/elijahcaine/buidlbot-rust-worker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a capable worker container, we need to create an arbitrary workload.
To do that we'll use this Buildbot &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master.cfg&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code diff literal-block"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And deploy it with this &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master.yaml&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code diff literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;diff --git a/blogpost/robust-master.yaml b/blogpost/robust-master.yaml
index c7479e3..f75b4d6 100644
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gd"&gt;--- a/blogpost/robust-master.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+++ b/blogpost/robust-master.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gu"&gt;&amp;#64;&amp;#64; -50,7 +50,7 &amp;#64;&amp;#64; spec:
&lt;/span&gt;         - name: BUILDBOT_CONFIG_DIR
           value: config
         - name: BUILDBOT_CONFIG_URL
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;-          value: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElijahCaine/buildbot-on-kubernetes/master/simple/master.cfg'
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+          value: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElijahCaine/buildbot-on-kubernetes/master/robust/master.cfg'
&lt;/span&gt;         - name: BUILDBOT_WORKER_PORT
           value: '9989'
         - name: BUILDBOT_WEB_URL
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at our setup in Buildbot it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Buildbot with ample workload." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/buildbot-on-k8s/ample-workload.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When each build is run it completely wipes away the old git clone and starts from scratch, which is &lt;em&gt;suuuper&lt;/em&gt; wasteful, but exactly what we want here.
The purpose of this test is to create a heavy workload for our nodes to perform, and with this each build will &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; be heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="kubectl-autoscale"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;kubectl autoscale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to start scaling that build.
In a perfect world we'd get a request, that would start hogging our resources, and K8s would spin up a new worker instance to handle the next build in the queue.
Based on the output of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;kubectl &lt;span class="pre"&gt;--help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; it looks like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;kubectl autoscale deployment worker&lt;/tt&gt; is the command we want... so let's do that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl autoscale deployment worker --max=5 --min=1 --cpu-percent=50
deployment &amp;quot;worker&amp;quot; autoscaled
$ kubectl describe hpa

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm... that output looks like things aren't working.
Let's look around the internet and see if we find anything useful.
I'll go East, you go West, and we'll meet back here in 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, what did you find?
Me?
Oh I found a bunch of Github issues &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#hpa-gh" id="id6"&gt;[hpa-gh]&lt;/a&gt; and Stack Overflow posts &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#hpa-so" id="id7"&gt;[hpa-so]&lt;/a&gt;; lot of people mentioned this Heapster thing.
The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster"&gt;Heapster GitHub page&lt;/a&gt; says it does &lt;em&gt;Compute Resource Usage Analysis and Monitoring of Container Clusters&lt;/em&gt;, which sounds like what we want.
I also found the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/horizontal-pod-autoscaling/"&gt;K8s Autoscaling&lt;/a&gt; docs that point to a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/horizontal-pod-autoscaling/"&gt;K8s Autoscaling Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.
That sounds super useful and confirms the suspicion that Heapster is useful.
&lt;strong&gt;TLDR&lt;/strong&gt; things are pointing toward setting up Heapster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out there is a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/README.md#add-ons"&gt;Heapster addon for Minikube&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#heapster-release" id="id8"&gt;[heapster-release]&lt;/a&gt;, so let's get that setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ minikube addons enable heapster
heapster was successfully enabled
$ minikube addons open heapster
Opening kubernetes service kube-system/monitoring-grafana in default browser...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;img alt="Heapster working" class="align-center" src="/assets/images/buildbot-on-k8s/hello-heapster.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neato!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we've got Heapster running, what's next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well the tutorial runs this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl run php-apache --image=gcr.io/google_containers/hpa-example --requests=cpu=200m --expose --port=80
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which we can appropriate to get some YAML to shove in our &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;worker.yaml&lt;/tt&gt; to get a good template for our Buildbot worker Deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl run test --image=busybox --requests=cpu=200m -o yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        ...
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 200m
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I added that section to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;worker.yaml&lt;/tt&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code diff literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;diff --git a/blogpost/robust-worker.yaml b/blogpost/robust-worker.yaml
index e57db12..de52320 100644
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gd"&gt;--- a/blogpost/robust-worker.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+++ b/blogpost/robust-worker.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gu"&gt;&amp;#64;&amp;#64; -42,15 +42,18 &amp;#64;&amp;#64; spec:
&lt;/span&gt;         tier: worker
     spec:
       containers:
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;-      - image: &amp;quot;buildbot/buildbot-worker:master&amp;quot;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+      - image: &amp;quot;quay.io/elijahcaine/buildbot-rust-worker:master&amp;quot;
&lt;/span&gt;         name: worker
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+        resources:
+          requests:
+            cpu: 200m
&lt;/span&gt;         env:
         - name: BUILDMASTER
           value: master
         - name: BUILDMASTER_PORT
           value: '9989'
         - name: WORKERNAME
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;-          value: example-worker
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+          value: rust-worker
&lt;/span&gt;         - name: WORKERPASS
           value: pass
         - name: WORKER_ENVIRONMENT_BLACKLIST
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... and ran &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;kubectl replace &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; worker.yaml&lt;/tt&gt;, but did it work?
Well, if you're impatient like me you'll keep refreshing, it won't look like it's working, and then you'll pull your hair out.
If that happens to you, just wait.
Wait like... a minute.
Just get some tea, stare out the window for a second, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; see if it worked or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ kubectl get hpa worker
NAME              REFERENCE                    TARGET    CURRENT   MINPODS   MAXPODS   AGE
worker            Deployment/worker            50%       0%        1         5         2m
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There. That looks good. Let's throw some work at it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few builds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
NAME              REFERENCE                    TARGET    CURRENT   MINPODS   MAXPODS   AGE
worker            Deployment/worker            50%       536%      1         5         6m
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! Let's check up on Buildbot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Replication failing." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/buildbot-on-k8s/replicas-didnt-work.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruh-roh that's not good...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dig in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Replication failing -- zoom, enhance." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/buildbot-on-k8s/failed-build.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not good...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it looks like that plan didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a bit more digging and I can say with certainty that the approach I took to scaling the workload did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work.
I can't say &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; for sure, and I definitely can't say how to fix it, but honestly... it's late.
I'm tired and right now I'm okay with throwing in the towel for now.
Maybe we'll solve this in a &lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="debrief"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debrief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First: This blogpost has a repo associated with it: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/elijahcaine/buildbot-on-kubernetes"&gt;https://github.com/elijahcaine/buildbot-on-kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please check that out, see what it has to offer, and make issues/pull requests.
Right now it's just a copy of the configs used in this project and a little bit of documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy hacking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm terrible at endings so I'm just gonna braindump some stuff here and let you, the beautiful and charming reader, find your own closure from all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="failure-its-what-s-on-the-menu"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Failure: its what's on the menu&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right, I didn't do what I set out to achieve.
Is that a bad thing?
&lt;strong&gt;Of course not!&lt;/strong&gt;
To quote the great Jake the Dog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QuotesPorn/comments/18a7m2/sucking_at_something_is_the_first_step_jake_the/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sucking at something is just the first step to being kinda good at something..." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/buildbot-on-k8s/sucking-quote.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure we didn't get the &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; BuildBot+K8s but we learned a ton and got &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; close!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="some-stuff-we-learned"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some stuff we learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are some things we learned that we should probably write down?
This is a pretty open question and if you followed along you'll &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; get a drastically different list than I have.
Here's the big things I feel like I'm walking away with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;cite&gt;kubectl &amp;lt;command&amp;gt; --dry-run -o yaml&lt;/cite&gt; is very useful for file-izing your infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K8s is very well documented &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; you are a very patient individual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage in K8s is still not a perfectly solved problem &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#storage" id="id9"&gt;[storage]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K8s applications share private networking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K8s Pods are really just containers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there's a ton more I've internalized and can't recall.
I tried to take thorough notes during this entire experience to capture the failures as well as the successes, which is a harder skill than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="useful-resources"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Useful resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond searching for specific answers these are &lt;em&gt;honestly&lt;/em&gt; the websites I kept going back to throughout this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kubernetes.io/docs/"&gt;http://kubernetes.io/docs/&lt;/a&gt;
The main K8s docs.
A bit dense and sparse in key areas, a problem I'm actively I'm working on.
Includes API docs and user-guides which are useful for those patient enough to read them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://k8s.info/"&gt;http://k8s.info/&lt;/a&gt;
A community-run resource with some useful links and a 'cheat sheet'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community"&gt;https://github.com/kubernetes/community&lt;/a&gt;
Includes a bunch of very useful design documentation.
I'm not usually the kind of person that enjoys reading design docs, but sometimes a feature is too new to have a usable user-guide.
When it's the best you've got, take it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as Buildbot-specific stuff I honestly just used the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.buildbot.net/current/"&gt;official Buildbot docs&lt;/a&gt; which were more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="whats-next"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Whats next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure I'll be posting more about K8s going forward.
It is a very useful tool because of/despite it's complexities.

Docs are a notable part of my identify, and I have a belief in the power of good documentation, but at the end of the day they &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; just a means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world docs wouldn't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to exist, so all docs should be enough to get whoever's readin them to the point where they can do cool shit on their own.
Just like a great cinematographer is so good you don't notice the camera in a movie, great docs should be so good you don't &lt;strong&gt;notice&lt;/strong&gt; how good they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's why I like &lt;strong&gt;doing&lt;/strong&gt; cool shit over &lt;strong&gt;reading&lt;/strong&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;It's also fun to play with toys! Even if those toys are software.&lt;/p&gt;

In the example the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;postgres&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;worker&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master&lt;/tt&gt; containers are all part of the same &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;buildbot&lt;/tt&gt; app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl class="last docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Autoscaling:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Autoscaling is important is because we've got a whole data-center (in theory) and we want to maximize how we use that data-center's computational abilities.
In a perfect world we would use exactly as much of the data-center as is demanded by users, but in practice this is super hard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say your website gets linked on Hacker News, you get tons of requests pouring in, but your poor little 2004 server falls on it's face when you &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; at it wrong, and &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; is where the exact page was hosted.
If you don't &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; that server fell down you'll never fix the problem or even &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; about the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;With an orchestrator we can (in theory) specify how much we want to utilize a our data-center's resources and under what conditions we want to use more or less resources.
If our service is creating a light load, only have one container up; if it's got a metric fuck-ton then spin up 20 containers across our entire cluster.
You say what you want and the load-balancer + scheduler + monitor take care of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Persistent Storage:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;The reason persistent storage is a useful feature is for two reasons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that containers are ephemeral.
They can be created, destroyed, and upgraded &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the time, basically making them the polar opposite of a 'Special Snowflake' service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nice, but what about state?
As nice as it'd be to make an entirely stateless data-center, cat pictures and builds aren't going to store themselves!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this problem is -- well it's not solved, but there's a clear direction things are going in.
The TLDR is that we create some block device in the cloud and mount it to each identical container at the same mount-point, so each container (K8s 'Pod') shares some amount of state.
Sorta like... I'm bad at examples actually. I'll think of one eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piggy-backing off of this, not only do we preserve state between container upgrades/deletes/additions, but we can also share state between scaled services (i.e., a set of identical containers across a datacenter).
Essentially we can have one worker pod carry out a build and another pod perform some action on that build (uploading it, verify it, archive it, etc).
When the first worker pod gets deleted the build lives on in the shared state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;This allows us to treat our state the same way we treat computing resources in the world of GIFFEE &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#gifee" id="id12"&gt;[GIFEE]&lt;/a&gt;.
Create some block device for the service, mount it to this point, and let your orchestrator take care of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table class="docutils citation" frame="void" id="gifee" rules="none"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label" /&gt;&lt;col /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="#id12"&gt;[GIFEE]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Google Infrastructure for Everyone Else&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table class="docutils citation" frame="void" id="storge" rules="none"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label" /&gt;&lt;col /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;[storge]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;But neither is storage in general so who can blame 'em?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prompt&lt;/h2&gt;

A baroness looks at the Mona Lisa and sees her newborn baby in the
background. - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/MagicRealismBot/status/768207599468634113"&gt;MagicRealismBot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lady Wangle (of the prestigious Canadian Royalty) flew to the Louvre for her
27th birthday.  In past visits she had always marveled at the beautiful marble
statutes, historic illustrations, and the grandiose building itself.  She
always loved the glass pyramid, even if she didn't really see how it fit with
the rest of the architecture.  The Louvre was a special place in her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wanted to bring her newborn daughter &lt;em&gt;Anna&lt;/em&gt; with but her husband &lt;em&gt;Harold&lt;/em&gt;
was concerned about the baby flying only two months after being born.  L.W.
offered to cancel the trip but he insisted that she go saying &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Sweetie,
you've been taking care of this baby for nine months.  You can take a week
off.  You deserve it.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  L.W. wasn't one to fight over things like this so she
packed for a three-day trip and went off to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an early riser, or perhaps just a jet-lagged riser -- she always wanted to
be an early riser but it wasn't in her genes.  Regardless, she was up early.
She didn't like the dark of mid January mornings, but that animosity was more
or less evened out by her love of being alone in the quiet frigid winter air.
She saw that the museum wouldn't open for another two hours and so she
adventured toward the big Ferris Wheel East of the museum.  She ultimately
intended to walk by the riverfront but settled for seeing some sights first.
She hadn't been to Paris in many years and was curious to see how it had
changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To her disappointment nothing had really changed in Paris.  She supposed that
was part of the charm; it was tastefully timeless.  One could come back year
after year and get the same Paris they'd gotten before.  Friends could visit
separately and talk about some hole-in-the-wall cafe they'd found independent
of one-another.  Any city built on a certain level of tourism &lt;strong&gt;had&lt;/strong&gt; to keep
the high-lights stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum opened and a small line had started to form.  She got in line and
held idle chit-chat with a couple from Dallas, Texas.  Their names were
Jeffery and Matilda Almond. They were eager to share that this was their way
of celebrating their 30th Anniversary with &lt;em&gt;'the honeymoon they never had'&lt;/em&gt;.
L.W. asked who was partial to seeing the Louvre to which Jeff proudly
exclaimed &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;It was all Matilda.  She got a degree in ART ya' know -- she's
real smart.  Most of this stuff goes way over my head but she's there to
explain it to me.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  Matilda blushed, she was the quiet one and Jeff was the
loud one of the pair, but she could tell they got along anyway.  L.W. smiled
at this and with that the conversation awkwardly petered out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.W. always made a bee-line for the Mona Lisa when she went to the Louvre.
She made the mistake of meandering there on one of her trips but by the time
she got to it it was too crowded (&lt;em&gt;only two hours after opening!&lt;/em&gt;) to see it.
She raced all of the Asian tourist families with their massive &lt;em&gt;Canon DSLR&lt;/em&gt;
cameras and was one of the first pairs of eyes to see it that day.  She took
it all in, noting yet again how much smaller it looks in real-life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wave after wave she took the piece in.  She knew there were better paintings
in the Louvre but something resonated with her about the &lt;em&gt;Mona Lisa&lt;/em&gt;.
Something was special, some connection... was that... was that Anna in the
background?  L.W.  peered at the piece and realized that an exact replication
of her daughter --&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry reader.  I can't do it.  I built this up too much and now... now the
... I'm not even sure what to call it. The punchline? It doesn't make any
sense.  I know the point of the MagicRealismBot stories isn't to make
something that &lt;em&gt;makes sense&lt;/em&gt; in a logical sense, but like... it should at
least be &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; and actions should be justified.  I'm not trying to
write an &lt;strong&gt;'and then'&lt;/strong&gt; story I'm trying to write a &lt;strong&gt;'therefore, and so'&lt;/strong&gt;
story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize.  This was just a bad story to begin with.  I avoided the prompt
for the majority of it anyway.  I even ignored that I had started this for
almost three weeks, hoping I'd come back and the story would magically &lt;em&gt;become
better&lt;/em&gt;.  I know that's not &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; a bad thing, but in this case it
wasn't a good sign -- delaying the inevitable usually means one is dread it.
That is kind of a necessity with these, take what you like from a prompt and
push the rest to the side, barely quantifying the thing as 'written from the
prompt'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm rambling now.  Thank you for reading, it means a lot.  I'll try to
do something more -- I don't know --  &lt;strong&gt;more better&lt;/strong&gt; in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

A paperweight whispers to a mathematician: &amp;quot;I feel so depressed.&amp;quot; -

&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fredrick Gustav was working well into the night as he was known to do in the
weeks preceding a publication of his work.  When he worked deep into the night
he took a drug called Caffeine in various forms from liquid to pill form to
stay awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the long nights he was also known to converse with furniture and inanimate
objects around the room which were up for a quick chat as he needed to rest.
If his 'people skills' were more astute (and there were people around to see
him) Fredrick might be embarrassed by his own behavior but the pros really did
outweigh the cons this late at night.  His bookshelf had many interesting
things to say but could sometimes overwhelm him.  His chair was also good to
talk with, but didn't get out much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight Fredrick's paperweight decided to speak up.  It was a small manatee
Beanie Baby and it started the conversation similar to how his bottom drawer
tended to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I feel so depressed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fredrick was shocked by the plush manatee.  It had never spoken up before and
quite frankly he wasn't sure it was able to until just now.  After the shock
subsided he responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well you're a new voice.  What might your name be there beanie baby manatee?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBM sighed and reflected on the question but was unable to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you have a name?  You've been around this office for almost a year now, it
seems about time I learned what to call you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBM responded positively to this idea and so Fredrick began the search for a
name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, it seems like &lt;em&gt;Snooty&lt;/em&gt; is a pretty famous manatee in Florida.  Mind if
I call you that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBM responded shyly &amp;quot;Yeah... that sounds okay...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fredrick, not picking up on the hesitation in BBM's voice, carried on proud of
his naming abilities and ready for the rest of the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wonderful.  So my next question is 'Why do you feel depressed Snooty?'&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snooty, who had not yet fully accepted the name, felt it was obvious why.  She
had been stuck in this office for over a year and why?  She was bought by a
mother and daughter and had &lt;em&gt;hoped&lt;/em&gt; that she would be adopted by them, but of
course she ended up being taken in by an old fart like Fredrick.  She couldn't
tell him that but it was how she felt.  Somehow she wanted to get out of here
and into the &lt;em&gt;real world&lt;/em&gt;.  She wanted to go to the park with a kid who named
her something infinitely more creative than 'Snooty'.  She wanted to go on
adventures and see wonders of the world outside people called &lt;em&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/em&gt;.
Despite her fear of his reaction she quickly mustered up the gumption to tell
Fredrick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I'm depressed because... because I'm stuck in this office when I could be on
adventures with a kid.  Adventures like... like I'm supposed to be on.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fredrick reflected on this for a while.  Glancing between her and the seventh
draft of his publication. He finally spoke up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I understand.  If I were you I'd want to get out of this office too.  Maybe
my daughter can find a good home for you, she works with children.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snooty was very excited at this prospect and if she could physically smile she
would have just then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours later Fredrick called it a night, packed up his things, and went
home with Snooty in his briefcase.  He arrive home at almost 2:47am and left
Snooty in the keys bowl.  He felt sad sometimes, coming home late to an empty
house.  Even his paper weight didn't like him, how could expect his wife and
children to do the same.  But he got up the next morning and did it all again.
At least he'd have his office to keep him company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

or contrarian but if it helps start a discussion I'll be happy. My only
intention is to contribute to an important conversation.  I appreciate you
taking the time to read it and hope you get something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="definition"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia (I trust it, don't you?) has an entry on self-censorship which
starts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Self-censorship is the act of censoring or classifying one's own blog, book,
film, or other forms of media. This is done out of fear of, or deference to,
the sensibilities or preferences (actual or perceived) of others and without
overt pressure from any specific party or institution of authority.
Self-censorship is often practiced by film producers, film directors,
publishers, news anchors, journalists, musicians, and other kinds of authors
including individuals who use social media.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're welcome to look at a few definitions which are more broad (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/self-censorship"&gt;Cambridge
def&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/self-censorship"&gt;Oxford def&lt;/a&gt;). I actually like using the Wikipedia entry, so I'll be
using it in this piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few highlights of the Wiki entry that I want to point out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-censorship can be caused by real or perceived sensibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is done out of fear or deference (submission/respect for others wishes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is mostly a voluntary action practiced by creators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is practiced by individuals producing everything from &amp;quot;big media&amp;quot; to
social media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like these four points because they set up a conflict I want to
explore: the Creator versus the Consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="consumer"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consumer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer watches, reads, or listens to something and when they find a
discrepancy which does not fit their mental model for what &lt;em&gt;that media&lt;/em&gt; should
do, they have the option to point it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;This character is a crude portrayal of bi-sexuality.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;This line was offensive to the elderly.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;This scene triggered me because I was almost killed in a car accident.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer points it out directly with the creator, to the creator publicly,
or to the public and not directly with the creator at all.  This archetype is
almost always acting in the interest of a racial, gendered, sexual, or social
minority and often they do so &lt;em&gt;on behalf&lt;/em&gt; of minorities which they themselves
are not apart of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a feminist I agree with the consumer’s intentions and with each individual
consumer who voice their concerns.  Just like a writer doesn't improve without
feedback so to a content creator cannot mindfully make more respectful work
without being made aware of the mistakes they have made.  Each individual
consumer, with exceptions of course, is a good person doing the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="creator"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creator wants to share an idea with the world.  They have the burning urge
to write, blog, podcast, televise, film, tweet, tumblr, paint, compose, etc.
Their intentions are also (usually) good.  This archetype wants to create
something great and share it with the world, or at the very least some
sub-culture they identify with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the creator &lt;em&gt;creates something&lt;/em&gt; they inevitably put a part of themselves
into &lt;em&gt;that thing&lt;/em&gt;.  When a consumer points out what &lt;em&gt;that something&lt;/em&gt; should
have done differently they are often a small voice in a hurricane of feedback.
This hurricane is often filled with positive feedback but the silent majority
that appreciate something often say nothing while the loud minority openly
share their thoughts and criticisms. Those who speak up are also known to
forget that a human being is going to read what they just hit &lt;strong&gt;send&lt;/strong&gt; on.
Even if the feedback is ultimately constructive the content creator is known
to only see the bad and fight to see the good. As a result of this personal
shit-storm for the creator, continuing to create becomes a fight against both
the creativity but also against their fans who care enough to &lt;em&gt;give them that
feedback&lt;/em&gt;, but deliver it in a hurtful or stressful way.  There have been many
stories in which a content creator who wanted to put themselves out there was
forced to pull back because of circumstances like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is best explained with an example, so here is an expert from an article
on The A.V. Club:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.avclub.com/article/steven-universe-writer-gets-hounded-twitter-fans-241092"&gt;Steven Universe writer gets hounded from Twitter by fans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online backlash was apparently quick, powerful, and seemingly coming
from two different directions: â€™shippers, irritated and outraged by what
they saw as Zuke pushing the agenda of her preferred pairing, and others
who accused the Cartoon Network show of engaging in â€œqueer baiting.â€
Among other definitions, the term refers to TV and film producers
introducing perceived sexual tension between two same-sex characters with
no intent of ever bringing the relationship to fruition, and is decried by
critics as a manipulative use of sexuality in order to draw in viewers and
attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criticism and attackers were apparently strong and frequent enough that
Zuke decided to shut down her social media presence, and close herself off
to â€œthousands of people who think because I work on a TV show that I owe
them myself all the time.â€ Her account has since been deleted, but a
screenshot of her last tweets is currently making the rounds online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instance the writer of a very progressive kids show (which I proudly
watch with my other adult friends) was ridiculed for... what?  Not being
perfect?  Not flawlessly pushing every equality agenda at once?  Ultimately it
may have been held to a &lt;em&gt;higher standard&lt;/em&gt; but to what end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern creators are being pushed and prodded by tens to hundreds to thousands
of tiny voices saying &amp;quot;This isn't right, do this better.&amp;quot;  As a result both
new and experienced creators feel a pressure to craft something which is
&lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;devoid of that which can be critiqued and judged&lt;/em&gt;.  A whole
generation of writers, directors, and story tellers are afraid to say
&lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; because it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be panned for it's imperfections and/or
perceived agenda.  The unfortunate part is that many forget that your work
&lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be critiqued no matter what you say.  In twenty years we'll be looking
back at 2016 and be flabbergasted by our ignorance about... I don't know --
laugh tracks.  The point being that we are not perfect creatures and so too
our creators are imperfect. We collectively acknowledge that, yet the creator
is punished harshly when they make a mistake, receiving a punishment which
does not match the crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main takeaway from all of this is that we should try to be mindful of the
creator's imperfections when pointing them out.  Time and time again the mass
of the internet is able to devastate the creators we have and scare the
creator's we don't.  We all say stupid things that we don't remember are
offensive or haven't yet been informed is offensive; whether somebody said an
offensive thing to an audience of millions or an audience of one  we shouldn't
criticize them just because we can.  A friend of mine put it pretty well when
he said '&lt;em&gt;On this road to social justice we're not all on the same page, let's
cut them some slack.&lt;/em&gt;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that I am saying this to nobody in particular.  The problems,
fear, and &lt;em&gt;weight of the internet&lt;/em&gt; are not something I have &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; in;
they are a concern all the same.  I am not well known and I have not &lt;em&gt;created&lt;/em&gt;
nor been thrown into any &lt;em&gt;shit-storms&lt;/em&gt; I talk about.  Those close to me have
experienced this trauma and they warn others like an oracle warns adventurers
not to go into the dark forest.  I understand that self-censorship is not a new
problem by any means, but since the &lt;em&gt;dawn of time&lt;/em&gt; there have been
individuals scared of change for completely rational reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be mindful of what you say and what you do not say on the internet.  As a fan
you have more influence than you think over the media you love.  Everything is
created by people &lt;em&gt;just like you&lt;/em&gt;.  Before you say something negative remember
that &lt;em&gt;a person will read it&lt;/em&gt;, so meditate on it before hitting &lt;em&gt;send&lt;/em&gt;.
Imagine reading it in the sea of everything else that person is dealing with.
Individuals should hold each other responsible but that doesn't mean you need
to &lt;em&gt;hurt&lt;/em&gt; them because they &lt;em&gt;offended&lt;/em&gt; you.  I wont advise you on when or how
to act because that is your responsibility.  If you find something truly
offensive of course you should tell the person who made it, but also remember
that you are in a unique position to be judge, jury, &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; executioner, even
if it is only on a small scale.  Having this power, meter your response to
match the crime and &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; before you &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all people.  We all want to do the right thing.  I don't mean to
discourage consumers from voicing their concerns, just to avoid &lt;em&gt;punishing&lt;/em&gt;
creators for imperfection.  In the world there is no good and bad only people
making the best of their situation with positive intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been actively learning programming for almost five years now. I started
by taking a C++ class at Portland Community College.  That class was the best
thing to happen to my engineering career because it taught me that
&lt;em&gt;programming is very hard, and I am not naturally good at it&lt;/em&gt;, but it was also
very rewarding so I stuck with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not special either, most of us aren't very good at programming because
it's so abstract and hard to grasp, like Math and Infinite Jest. There are of
course the people that seem like &lt;em&gt;programming gods&lt;/em&gt;, but nine times out of ten
those people have been programming since they were eight and it's really not
fair to compare yourself to them.  That's like comparing your sporting
abilities to &lt;em&gt;any olympic athlete&lt;/em&gt;.  Don't be so hard on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In learning to program, and now teaching others how to program, I've
identified a few &lt;strong&gt;hurdles&lt;/strong&gt; (mountains, cliffs, obstacles, w/e) that folks
tend to hit and have trouble crossing.  They always get past these hurdles
eventually (or they quit CS ☹), but not without a bit of unnecessary struggle.
Struggling builds character, and I don't want to cheat anybody out of that,
but I do want to help those that want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will in no way guarantee your success in overcoming these obstacles
but it should at least give you a head start to help you understand what you're
learning and point you in the right direction when you want to ask a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="data-structures"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data Structures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that &lt;strong&gt;a lot of programming is basically manipulating data to
fit a need&lt;/strong&gt; is pretty important.  A social network can be thought of as a
bunch of people's personal information plugged into a bunch of algorithms to
make connecting easier.  A word processor is really just a front-end for some
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_XML_formats"&gt;XML under the hood&lt;/a&gt;, which is itself &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML"&gt;just a way to represent structured
data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When handling data try to keep in mind what you are trying to accomplish and
the best way to structure the data in the pursuit of that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure"&gt;Arrays/Lists/Vectors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrays and Lists are an ordered data type&lt;/strong&gt;.  Use them when you need to
keep track of the order things happened in, like queuing an event.  Try to
keep them &lt;em&gt;relatively small&lt;/em&gt; since they are fast for retrieval but not
inherently space efficient.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table"&gt;Hash-table/Key-Value/Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hashes are useful for storing unordered data&lt;/strong&gt; with keys, like an address
book or a small database. We use them to access data quickly and easily
since data is retrieved using a key and always takes approximately the
same amount of time.  When you get data out of a dictionary you provide a
key and get back the associated data, just like (you guessed it) &lt;em&gt;a real
dictionary&lt;/em&gt; where provided the word you get back a definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Hash-tables are useful tools but should only be used for &lt;em&gt;relatively
small&lt;/em&gt; amounts of data.  There is a bit of overhead in creating the table
for storing your data so if your data-set gets too big you'll run out of
memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list"&gt;Linked Lists/Sorted Trees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Linked Lists and Sorted Trees aren't exactly the same thing but I'm
lumping them together because they both deal with a lot of the same
concepts and can be implemented in similar ways.  In learning about LL/ST
you'll probably deal with Structs, Nodes, Pointers, and dynamic memory
allocation, which if you're like me will totally break your brain and then
become second-nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One advantage to these structures is that they can be implemented to
take up only the space they require&lt;/strong&gt;.  Where Hash-maps and lists are hard
to make the &lt;em&gt;right size&lt;/em&gt;, LL/ST can only take up exactly as much room as
they need.  The trade-off (a word you hear a lot when dealing choosing
data structures) is that they're not always the &lt;em&gt;fastest&lt;/em&gt; way to
store/retrieve data.  Just consider your use-case and think about what you
need for the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;If you're interested in learning Rust though there's a great guide on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/too-many-lists/book/README.html"&gt;Learning Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists&lt;/a&gt;. I do suggest it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are all just the structures you're giving your data&lt;/strong&gt; (a series of
ones and zeros on disk and in memory).  Anybody that's done work with a
sufficiently complicated project (e.g., the Linux Kernel) can tell you that
one glob of data can be treated as a Linked List, Array, Hash -- or all three
at the same time!  The structure you give your data is just so &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can work
with it, the computer doesn't really care one way or another, so choose what
makes the most sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speaking of data structures...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="objects-classes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Objects/Classes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objects are logical groupings of data (variables) and functions that act on
that data&lt;/strong&gt;.  They differ from structs in that they are (usually) private by
default, meaning that variables declared in an object are not accessible from
the &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; unless you explicitly say so. Variables are usually manipulated
via a method called a &lt;em&gt;getter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;setter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... what I've actually described so far is creating a &lt;strong&gt;class: aka a
blueprint for an object&lt;/strong&gt;.  This python is a pretty succinct way to describe
classes and objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
objects_example.py

Declare a class named BazClass.
&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;BazClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        The __init__ function sets class variables and sets up the object.
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;var1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;var2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        a() acts on the object variables (accessed via `self`).
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Variable you set &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;var1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Variable set by class definition &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;var2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
Creating an instance of the class and call the `a()` function.
&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;foo_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;BazClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;foo_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objects are something that will &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt; after you use the for a while.
There's some nuances and implementation quirks depending on the language
you're using, but in the end they're just logical collections of private data
and functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="functional-programming"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Functional Programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"&gt;Functional Programming&lt;/a&gt; (FP) was my first big paradigm shift in CS since
functions.  FP includes concepts of variable immutability (once it's set it's
set), callbacks (functions calling functions and propagating results up),
program state -- the list goes on.  Here's an example to get us started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-functional paradigm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code javascript literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;average_evens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;avg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;avg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;avg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;avg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;avg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional Paradigm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code javascript literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;average_evens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the non-functional example one would create a variable, iterate with a
for-loop, and return a variable at the end.  In the functional example you
call functions which return data that you handle (callback) and that result is
added to or replaces the original data.  I'm honestly not doing this topic
justice but it's one of those things you either learn first or you learn the
hard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the tip of the ice-berg; many people prefer functional
programming. If you are even remotely interested you should find one of
those people and let them talk your ear off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're learning functional programming I suggest either &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters"&gt;Learn You a
Haskell for Great Good&lt;/a&gt; if you're interested in learning Haskell (which is
interesting an interesting language if nothing else) or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/functional-programming-python.csp"&gt;Functional
Programming in Python&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;pythonistas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="frameworks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frameworks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frameworks are a collection of libraries, methods, and tools to accomplish a
specific type of task&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you want to get something &lt;em&gt;complicated&lt;/em&gt; done
&lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;, you'll use a framework.  Take for instance a web-app like Facebook or
Twitter: it needs to be able to &lt;em&gt;send/receive HTTP requests&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;interface with
a database&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;craft database queries&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;render web-pages&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; whatever the
actual website is supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frameworks can be very small or very large but they are always a big hurdle
for those of us that have never worked with one before.  A good starter
framework I suggest is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://flask.pocoo.org/"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; for Python-based web-apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="testing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing is writing a program to test your program&lt;/strong&gt;.  There are many different
&lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of tests from &lt;em&gt;unit tests&lt;/em&gt; (checking single functions), to
&lt;em&gt;integration tests&lt;/em&gt; (checking that your functions work &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;), to &lt;em&gt;random
tests&lt;/em&gt; (trying to break your program by telling a computer to break your
functions by using they in weird ways).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that first program you wrote for class?  You wrote one that prompted
the user for data and then manipulated that input in some way?  Remember how
you tested that?  Probably in the most tedious way imaginable: &lt;strong&gt;by hand&lt;/strong&gt;.
Tests are much easier to write than your actual code and while they're a
tedious investment up-front it's a small commitment relative to the &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt;
you'd spend checking your program every time you made a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="troubleshooting"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing isn't really about programming but about &lt;em&gt;fixing&lt;/em&gt; your
programming.  When you're learning a new paradigm, language, or framework
you're going to spend a lot of time &lt;em&gt;fixing&lt;/em&gt; what doesn't currently work much
more than you're going to actually be producing working code.  This skill can
also be summed up as 'How to Read Error Messages and Google well'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My troubleshooting advice is to &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; the error message, don't give up,
and search for anything that looks meaningful.  Once you find an answer try to
&lt;em&gt;grok&lt;/em&gt; what the answer means so you can learn &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; that worked instead of
knowing &lt;em&gt;if I type this in a certain way it will not fall down&lt;/em&gt;.  Future you
will appreciate the investment you put into &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; the problem and
it's solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also don't be afraid to experiment. Make a copy of your program (or use
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt;) and see if some crazy idea is exactly what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list is far from complete but it still felt worth sharing.  If you think
I missed something, &lt;a class="reference external" href="/about/#contact"&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; and I might do a follow-up post.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="section" id="prompt"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prompt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By looking at a fireplace, a medieval sorcerer can turn stone into
moonstones.  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/MagicRealismBot/status/766606956295356420"&gt;MagicRealismBot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellyn scrambled to take notes as fast as she could.  She had finally found a
way to produce &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;/strong&gt; and it would change &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;!  With
&lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;/strong&gt; one could turn sand into gold, the living into the dead, and
countless other &lt;em&gt;theoretical&lt;/em&gt; properties she had read of.  Now that she was
able to produce that which had alluded sorcerers since the dawn of knowledge
the sky was the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took her quill and parchment and wrote furiously.  She described in great
detail the position of the Sun in the Sky, the time of year, where she stood in
the room and where the room stood on Earth.  She knew every detail wouldn't be
important but every detail &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be so they all must be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standing my robes, staring intently at 12 BoilingRocks in the fireplace,
facing head-first at the display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sun stands high in a Summer's fore-noon, just glancing through the
window unto the fireplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the duration of approximately three Hail Mary's the stones turned
white and fragile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rocks no-doubt turned into &lt;strong&gt;MoonStones&lt;/strong&gt; as was theorized.  Their
shape and texture proves it so.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The MoonStones glow faint white, matte and with hints of spiritual
aura.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;MoonStones&lt;/strong&gt; weigh substantially less than the BoilingRocks did,
perhaps losing mass in the process of transformation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she finished writing her findings she grabbed her wax and seal and marked
it to be delivered to her mentor Rowan.  He had spent the better part of his
long life (&lt;em&gt;76 years young!&lt;/em&gt;) attempting to find the secret to producing
&lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;/strong&gt; from earthly materials but had come up empty-handed.  Ellyn felt
proud of her findings and was glad to be able to share it with Rowan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments later Ellyn sent off her findings with a sample of the &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;/strong&gt;
via the local carrier.  She told him to &lt;em&gt;take it with haste to Rowan&lt;/em&gt; and gave
the carrier an extra copper piece in hopes that he would.  The carrier ran off
down the road, the journey was almost a quarter day's travel so Ellyn returned
to her study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she sat in wait studying the &lt;strong&gt;MoonStones&lt;/strong&gt;, she grew weary of her
findings.  Just a moment ago she was so sure of her discovery, but now that
she had sent off the finding she became... hesitant.  Was this &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;/strong&gt;
or perhaps the similar &lt;em&gt;SilverStone&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;/strong&gt; was only theoretical,
studied in the mind and never before in the hand; it had never been proven to
exist so what made her so sure that &lt;em&gt;this rock&lt;/em&gt; was what they had been
searching for.  She was, after all, just an apprentice sorcerer; what did she
know?  If Rowan determined her findings untrue what would stop him from
revoking his mentor ship?  Her years of study would be for naut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellyn had always been prone to worry. She took a deep breath and with nothing
else to do, she sat in wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A ghoul and an archbishop are fighting over custody of their children.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/MagicRealismBot/status/749301833881915392"&gt;MagicRealismBot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like every Friday night, Debra picked up her two daughters from her
ex-wife's house in Evanston and drove them downtown for the weekend.  As she
drove away in her red 2008 Corolla with them she got a text message from her
ex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From: Gwendolyn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Debra,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please bring Lilyan and Odell back by 9pm on Sunday.  They have school
Monday morning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debra became immediately filled with rage.  &lt;em&gt;'Of course they both have school
Monday morning!  I'm not stupid!  I've been doing this for four and a half
years goddammit.  How stupid does she think I am?  Christ she can be such a
--'&lt;/em&gt; and before she went down that rabbit hole she remembered what her
therapist said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just breath.  Everything is going to be okay.  This is just temporary.  Her
bitchy behavior only affects you if you let it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debra drove a few more miles, her daughters in the back staying cautiously
silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually Lilyan spoke up. &amp;quot;Debora, why does mommy so mean to you?&amp;quot;
deliberately calling Debra (or &lt;strong&gt;Debora&lt;/strong&gt; in Lilyan's case) by her name and
Gwen by &lt;em&gt;'mommy'&lt;/em&gt;.  This used to bug Debra but she eventually became apathetic
toward the situation.  Gwendolyn had brainwashed the kids; she was honestly
just glad she was able to fight and keep her daughters on the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; mommy so mean to me. And sweety, I'm a ghoul and that means that
&lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people don't really like me.&amp;quot; Debra said matter-of-factly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Like racism?&amp;quot; Lilyan asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Exactly like racism Lily.  And your mother is a Christian official called an
'Archbishop'.  For some reason, probably some squabble hundreds of years ago
[or maybe they've just always been biggots] none of your mother's bosses liked
that she was in a relationship me so she had to give it up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a momentary pause as the girls thought this over.  Lilyan was six
and Odell was eight, neither of which were really prepared to fully process
what she was saying, but she wanted them to feel respected and independent so
she participated in their questions.  They were both technically Gwendolyn's
daughters with a donor, Debra would have had child if she was able to but
ghouls had a notorously difficult time doing anything related to &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt;,
creating life included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But why does she not like you?&amp;quot; Lilyan finally asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debra sighed.  &amp;quot;Well, I think she doesn't like me because she wishes we could
still be together.  We had a very romantic fling in the beginning and we
really thought we could stay together but... well it wasn't meant to last.
She just thinks that this is the best way to deal with the situation.  Some
people would rather feel angry than sad.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilyan quickly followed up with the obvious &amp;quot;Do you feel sad Debora?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debra thought for a moment. Lilyan asked again &amp;quot;Do you feel sad Debora?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sometimes sweetie.  Sometimes I feel very sad and it makes it very hard to do
things like go to work and eat food.  Most of the time that happens I remind
myself how lucky I am to have you two to look forward to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilyan didn't know what else to ask and so the three sat in silence as they
drove down Lake-Shore Drive.  The lamp posts cast yellow-tinged shadows on
their faces as they each looked out the windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odell finally spoke up, &amp;quot;What are we going to do this weekend?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good question.  What do you guys want to do?  I was thinking we could go
mini-golfing once you get your homework done.  How does that sound?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both groaned. Debra smiled &amp;quot;Well I guess it's settled. Mini putt-putt
tomorrow afternoon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

fist&lt;/em&gt; and an endless stream of &lt;em&gt;Puns&lt;/em&gt;.  His wife and three daughters obeyed
his every whim, when it fit their schedules... and if they were in a good
mood... and they wanted to.  Stan was content with his life as an emperor and
ruler of his domain, no matter how far and wide that domain spanned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Tuesday afternoon, as he stood at the edge of the sidewalk squinting
toward his back yard and telling himself that &lt;em&gt;'Stantinople stretches as far
as the eye can see'&lt;/em&gt;, his mind drifted to the life he could have had.  He
thought about all of the mistakes he had made like when he tried stand-up and
totally bombed, when he got into massive debt from college and dropped out,
and when he bought a house in the suburbs -- the mistakes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seemingly out of nowhere he was tapped on the nose by a delivery woman.  She
told him to sign her PDA and before he could process what was happening she
dropped a thick wooden, about the size of a bedside table, at his doorstep.
He turned around and the woman sped away in an un-marked FedEx van; it didn't
say FedEx, because it was unmarked, but the color and shape was right so Stan
figured it probably was FedEx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lugged the box into the house and down to the finished basement he (and a
poster in the stairwell leading down to the basement) called the
&lt;strong&gt;'Stantinople Man Cave'&lt;/strong&gt;, despite it not having many &lt;em&gt;Man Cave&lt;/em&gt; amenities
nor being an actual cave for which one might find men.  The entirety of the
basement consisted of three dark brown leather couches lined up in an 'L'
formation in the corner and a small, almost child-sized foosball table on the
opposite end of the room.  He didn't even invest in a wide-screen TV and a few
Lay-Z boy chairs with built-in mini-fridges!  Stan really had no concept of
what a &lt;em&gt;Man Cave&lt;/em&gt; ought to have but nobody really called him on it since he
was obviously trying his sad 43 year-old best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He fumbled the box with a &lt;em&gt;WHOOMP&lt;/em&gt; onto the carpet and painlessly opened it
with its &lt;em&gt;No Hassle™ packaging&lt;/em&gt;, an innovation he did not realized had made
its way to wooden packaging.  Removing the item Stan thought this new device
was a sewing machine and he got excited, but upon closer inspection he
realised it was not a sewing machine.  The device was a rectangular cube with
rounded edges and was hollow in the middle except for what looked like some
pistons; the device was matt black and had four rubber feet on the bottom and
was branded &lt;em&gt;'Past Scrubber'&lt;/em&gt;.  He lifted the device out of the box and
flipped 'on' the devices only switch; it began to &lt;em&gt;whurrrrrr&lt;/em&gt; like a small
engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stan rummaged through the box and found a piece of paper which read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
May this device only be used by the mightiest and wisest emperors.  With
its mechanical power it may erase both mistakes and triumphs of the past.
It does not discriminate, this is the job of its master.  You are its
master.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sweet! This thing looks cool.&amp;quot; Stan said oblivious to the ominous tone of
this note. &amp;quot;Let's see... it can change the past.  I wonder what I should
change...&amp;quot; he said foolishly not taking this very serious device seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well first I'd wish I'd never moved out to the suburbs.  That was a huge
mistake.&amp;quot; The machine's &lt;em&gt;whurrr&lt;/em&gt;'ing intensified and an instant later he found
himself living in a nice apartment near down-town.  Since time had been
altered, and in this universe you don't remember old timeliness if you change
the past (deal with it), Stan had no idea that anything had changed and had
yet to make his first decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well first I'd wish I never went to college, that was a huge waste of time
just to drop out.&amp;quot; and again (for you, not for him) the machine &lt;em&gt;whurrr&lt;/em&gt;'d
louder and an instant later Stan found himself in a much shittier apartment,
further from downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well first I'd wish I went to college, I really could have done something
with my life.&amp;quot; and the machine didn't respond because, despite it's visual
similarities to a sewing machine, the device only knew how to destroy time and
not how to create it.  He would have known this if he read the freaking manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stan quickly grew bored with the device after naming off a few things he
&lt;em&gt;wished&lt;/em&gt; he had done and it just &lt;em&gt;whurr&lt;/em&gt;'ing on.  He switched the machine
&lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; and put it in the corner and muttered to himself &amp;quot;Maybe I can get
something for it on ebay.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a furious bidding war between two hobbyist mechanics Stan got $153 for
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not bad.&amp;quot; He said when the bidding ended. &amp;quot;Not bad indeed.&amp;quot; and smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gwendolyn and Stefan love to try new things.  Not like... &lt;em&gt;sex things&lt;/em&gt;, but
like &lt;em&gt;lifestyle things&lt;/em&gt;.  Take, for example, Gwendolyn decided last week that
she would love to see what life was like if she and Stefan only shared &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt;
bowl, plate, cup, fork, knife, spoon, and pan for a month. She didn't really
have a good reason for &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; at the time, it's not like she read it in a
magazine or anything, but they're young and into wacky stuff like that.  Stefan
always participates in these and likes talking about their &lt;em&gt;adventures&lt;/em&gt; as
they're happening, but never proposes ideas of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwendolyn requires that people use the full &lt;em&gt;Gwendolyn&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;Gwen&lt;/em&gt; and has
been known to &lt;strong&gt;halt&lt;/strong&gt; conversations if people don't. She feels was confident
that she loves Stefan three times more than he loves her.  She wasn't sure why
she felt that way, or where three times came from, but it had always been her
hunch.  Since she's never been able to confirm or deny it, she has kept on
believing it; this puts her in an artificially smug mood whenever she
sacrifices something for Stefan, like the 5% markup on the organic foods
because he prefers them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefan previously refereed to her as &lt;em&gt;Gwen&lt;/em&gt; internally but forced himself to
adapt after a few preventable meltdowns.  He hasn't ever really considered how
much he loves Gwendolyn, but he regularly thinks about the house they'll buy
together in a few years.  There isn't actually a specific house they're
thinking about, but he still enjoys the fantasy; some women dream of their
wedding day and Stefan dreams of his move-in day.  Year after year they've
stayed in the same mid-town loft and will never did move into that house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both definitely &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; each other to the extent that any
twenty-somethings can love one another while still collectively managing to
avoid the question of marriage.  They will eventually break-up, not because of
any one event or central cause, but because people grow up and grow apart.
It's never anybody's fault, it's just how the wind blows.  Some people's
connections are able to persevere that inevitable break, but this connection
will not.  Gwendolyn knows this and in the back of her head is already thinking
about why a breakup would be best for them.  Stefan has thought about it once
or twice but doesn't really want things to change.  He likes spending his life
with Gwendolyn and feels like they do share a really close bond, even if that
bond is largely based on things like sharing one bowl, plate, cup, fork, knife,
spoon, and pan for a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the &lt;em&gt;sharing-one-of-everything&lt;/em&gt; thing is working out pretty well.
Gwendolyn hasn't gotten any of their friends to try it but she really feels
like she's looking at food and meals in a whole new light.  Stefan thinks it's
a neat idea, but is looking forward to the end of this month.  He would
never tell her that though.  He loves her too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition warning"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;This post does not cover &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; python exceptions are. If the above
code doesn't make sense you should check out this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/HandlingExceptions"&gt;Introduction to Python
Exceptions&lt;/a&gt; from wiki.python.org before reading this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've fallen in love with Python you've no doubt discovered exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# do a thing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# thing did not work,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# do something else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are endlessly useful and help one to avoid writing checks upon checks upon
checks before getting to the meat of your project. Just try a thing, catch the
error, keep on rolling (or fail gracefully).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As powerful as they can be, I have found a lot of folks (past me included) who
don't know how to find python exceptions and don't know how to write their own
exceptions! So let's do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="finding-exceptions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding Exceptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing exception handling code it's kosher to explicitly state &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt;
error you expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Bad:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# A thing that might not work&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Something else&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Good:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# A thing that might not work&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SpecificError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Maybe print(err)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Something else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first found this out I thought &lt;em&gt;Golly that does sound useful; I always
try to be explicit in my error handling -- but how??&lt;/em&gt; Thankfully future me is
here to answer questions like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exception you are looking for (for instance, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;SpecificError&lt;/tt&gt; in the above
pseudo-code) can be found in the python traceback:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ echo &amp;quot;open(&amp;#39;myfakefile.txt&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;r&amp;#39;).close()&amp;quot; &amp;gt; my-unhandled-script.py
$ python my-unhandled-script.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &amp;quot;/tmp/test.py&amp;quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;
    open(&amp;#39;myfakefile.txt&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;r&amp;#39;).close()
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: &amp;#39;myfakefile.txt&amp;#39;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That bit on the last line &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;IOError&lt;/tt&gt; is the exception you're looking for. So
when you write your code you'll say something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;myfakefile.txt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;r&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;IOError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;File `myfakefile.txt` does not exist&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap, here is one way (and my preferred method for) 'doing' python
exception handling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write breakable code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run breakable code, see what exceptions python spits out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrap breakable code in explicit &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;try/except&lt;/tt&gt; blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;???&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="writing-your-own-exceptions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing Your Own Exceptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You (who me?), yes &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can write custom python exceptions. It's dead easy
too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long and short of it is you define an exception class which either inherits
from the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Exception&lt;/tt&gt; class or another pre-existing exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CusssstomError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;Raise when snakes&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;check_for_snakes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;snake&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;CusssstomError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Snakes! I hate snakes!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Just don&amp;#39;t mention snakes: &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;check_for_snakes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;CusssstomError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Thanks. I appreciate it.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above code defines the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;CusssstomError&lt;/tt&gt; exception class which you can
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;raise&lt;/tt&gt;. Very neat and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-pythonic"&gt;pythonic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="last"&gt;If you would like help with the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript I suggest
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website"&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Development, especially the front-endy stuff, is a great way to understand
how computers &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; and can be a wonderful foray into computer programming.
Anybody that's made a website probably remembers their first time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up a text editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type something like the following in:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello world!&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is so cool!&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Save As index.html&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click and open the file in your browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marvel at what you've created and hack away at it all night long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there you go! You've got a website made and ready to roll. It's not on a
server, and you can't tell your friends to go to it from &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; computer --
but those are just technicalities. You can still celebrate doing a thing &lt;em&gt;like a
boss&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when you test your website by viewing local files you're missing
out on a lot of advantages and quirks that you get when you host a website on a
&lt;em&gt;real server&lt;/em&gt; using something like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server"&gt;Apache or Nginx&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, when you run check your website by clicking through
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;file///home/username/project/files.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; all of your hyperlinks that should
point to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;http://mywebsite.ext/somepage/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will take you to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;file:////somepage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
when they should take you to
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;file:///home/username/projects/myawesomesite/somepage/index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="run-a-development-server-it-s-easy"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Run A Development Server (it's easy!)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-short-answer"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Short Answer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Python!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-longer-answer"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Longer Answer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can run your own local webserver to serve files &lt;em&gt;locally&lt;/em&gt;. This gets you
all of the developmental advantages of running a webserver without having to
rent or run a server in the cloud. The best part is that it's very easy to run
a development web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://python.org/downloads/"&gt;Install Python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;your-awesome-website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; directory/folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;python &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; SimpleHTTPServer&lt;/tt&gt; if you installed &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;python2&lt;/tt&gt; or run
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;python &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; http.server&lt;/tt&gt; if you installed &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;python3&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;These instructions assume you are doing things in a Unix environment (OSX
or Linux) thought the commandline. If you are using Windows you should
check out this &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17351016/set-up-python-simplehttpserver-on-windows"&gt;stack overflow post&lt;/a&gt; for Windows-specific help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in your web browser go to the address &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;http://localhost:8000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and bam!
&lt;strong&gt;Your&lt;/strong&gt; Website.&lt;/p&gt;

You got Docker in my Firefox!&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Turns out you can run Firefox in Docker. It's actually pretty easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="code"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/ElijahCaine/29e7e829341d58abe370"&gt;my github gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/ElijahCaine/29e7e829341d58abe370.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installation instructions (on Linux):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code text literal-block"&gt;
# install docker and start the docker daemon
$ git clone https://gist.github.com/29e7e829341d58abe370.git docker-firefox
$ ln docker-firefox/ff-docker /some/path/for/binaries
$ ff-docker -b  # -b pulls &amp;amp; builds container, etc used for first time startup.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="notes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempted to use &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alpinelinux.org/"&gt;Alpine Linux&lt;/a&gt; as a proof-of-usability, since it's the hip
new kid on the containerization block &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, but as it turns out Alpine's
Firefox package is pretty fucked &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dmenu"&gt;dmenu&lt;/a&gt;, this means I can run &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ff-docker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; from my desktop without
opening a terminal, effectively making it a super-private-yet-convenient
drop-in for Firefox.  Pretty neat right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was pretty simple but effective in terms of giving me the option to have
more privacy. I can see it being extended to add even more security; e.g.,
routing all of the traffic in the container through a VPN would be easy enough.
Food for thought [citation needed].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id3" rules="none"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label" /&gt;&lt;col /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="#id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5mb containers sounds pretty nice to me.

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This weekend I went to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://catbarcamp.org/"&gt;Cat Barcamp 2015&lt;/a&gt;, an unconference run by the PSU
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cat.pdx.edu/"&gt;Computer Action Team&lt;/a&gt;. I went to some awesome talks (and gave one myself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed every talk I went to. Here they are in order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History of Cryptography.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This was given by one of my OSL co-workers. It didn't contain a ton of new
information for me, but was delivered very well and focused on different
types of cryptography and the context in which each one was developed. I
enjoyed it.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haskell on Steroids.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I kinda checked out during this talk because I wanted to write my slides...
Wooops. It looked very interesting and mathey though...&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Test Driven Development in Power Shell.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Whoa Windows! (actually though, I learned more about Power Shell than I
ever expected to know).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MY TALK.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="#my-talk"&gt;(see below)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Whirlwind Tour of Lojban.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Lojban seems like a cool language. Corbin (previous LUG president) gave
this talk, he's a cool guy... you might even say he's TheMostAwesomeDude.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adventures in IT Security: Then and now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I like history. I also like computers. This was a good talk. I am biased.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talking to people! (or, How I learned to stop worrying and love the user.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Spoiler: The secret is understanding social cues.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-talk"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Talk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided on the spur of the moment to give a talk 'How to Write a (very
mediocre) Static Site Generator' and with only 40 minutes of prep work I was
able to fill an hour pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some links from that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/ElijahCaine/0ee1ef21692f3cbb6934"&gt;demo code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://elijahcaine.me/catbarcamp2015-demo/"&gt;abomination of a website&lt;/a&gt; we built between the demo and the end of the
session (epilepsy warning... no seriously).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://slides.elijahcaine.me/cat-barcamp-2015_how-to-an-ssg/"&gt;very sparse slides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tldr"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TLDR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAT is an awesome group of people. I'm glad I was able to get a few LUG
members to come to the event. If I went to PSU I would be honored to work with
the CAT. They throw a hellofan event.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="#the-deets-dockerfile-and-commands"&gt;Jump to the codey bits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-problem-workstations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem: Workstations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the OSL I use workstations which are provisioned by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef_%28software%29"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt; to look more or
less identical (packages are the same and global config files are consistent
from machine to machine). This is nice because it allows everybody at the lab
to jump from workstation to workstation without dreading the inevitable setup
that usually comes with going to a new computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only downside here is that to install a package you have to make a pull
request to a GitHub Repository in which you modify a JSON file. This is almost
always for my own good, but as a dev I am prone to avoiding things that the
admins say are good for me (like broccoli, milk, and consistent workstation
environments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, yesterday I wanted to use &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/"&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/a&gt; to grab a video I was
watching on repeat*. I could have made a pull request to add the package,
waited until 30 after for the workstations to refresh, used the package, and
went about my day. This would have been the correct and bureaucratic way to do
things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have, and probably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have, done that... but I didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* firefox kept crashing, I wasn't just stealing music for the sake of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="enter-docker"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enter: Docker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case the solution to the 'problem' was &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_%28software%29"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote a Dockerfile
which provisioned a container to have &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; installed, spun up the
container with a shared directory (&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;$PWD:/home/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;), and executed the
youtube-dl command. The .mp4 video was downloaded to my current working
directory and I was able to play it with my media player of choice, all without
installing &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-deets-dockerfile-and-commands"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Deets: Dockerfile and Commands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get -y update
RUN apt-get -y upgrade
RUN apt-get -y install python-pip
RUN pip install youtube-dl

WORKDIR /home
RUN alias youtube-dl=&amp;#39;/usr/local/bin/youtube-dl&amp;#39;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in the directory containing the above Dockerfile, build the
container with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ docker build -t yt-dl .
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and run it with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ docker run -v $PWD:/home/ yt-dl youtube-dl &amp;lt;YOUTUBE-VID-URL&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will download any url's video into the current working directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pro-tip-add-an-alias"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pro-Tip: Add an &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Alias&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the following content to your &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; file and then run &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;source
&lt;span class="pre"&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to get rid the of long Docker bits of the above command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$VID_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/path/to/downloaded/videos/
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; yt-dl&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;docker run -v $VID_DIR:/home/ yt-dl youtube-dl&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="wait-this-is-overly-complicated"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wait This is Overly Complicated&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're probably thinking: &amp;quot;Hey, couldn't you have just run &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pip install &lt;span class="pre"&gt;--user&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pre"&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. I could have. But that wouldn't be fun and wouldn't have given me an
excuse to write a blog, post now would it Ms. Smarty Pantz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;drink the coolaid. come to the docker side.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Write the docs Day 2 is just as educational as the first.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just like yesterday, I spent most of today enjoying some wonderful talks as
well as stressing out -- I mean totally not stressing out -- about my own talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Write the Docs Staff Picture" class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/wtd-day-2.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Write the Docs Staff saying thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first talk of the day was titled &amp;quot;Judas Priest Ate My Scrum Master&amp;quot;,
which has almost nothing to do with Judas Priest or eating or scrum masters;
instead it talked about things that are well known issues and a lot of laws
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%E2%80%99_law"&gt;Brooks' Law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman's_laws_of_software_evolution"&gt;Lehmann's Laws&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle"&gt;Pareto Principle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law"&gt;Conway's Law&lt;/a&gt;,
etc) that nobody talks about that much but can be super helpful to consider
when working in an industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second talk covered different types of user interfaces and what to
consider when writing error messages, troubleshooting pages, product tours.
It was something I hadn't considered having primarily written command line
tools with pretty limited and well established interface guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I gave a talk. It was a talk. I'll post a video of it once those
get put up online and you can decide if it was good or bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The talk after mine was a nice history lesson and wanted the audience to
reflect on what documentations can learn from documentation practices of the
past. The TLDR on that one is that it used to suck to write technical docs
even more than it sucks now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then there were a bunch of lightning talks. One talk from a twitter employee
(there's a fun name for them I'm sure) mentioned that gathering metrics are
is important because without metrics everything you do is just guess and
check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next talk &amp;quot;MacGyvering your docs&amp;quot; brought up the fact that the best
documentation toolchain will (should?) only help existing developers. A
better toolchain won't attract new devs. That was something I think a lot of
projects can lose sight of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The talk after that covered a team of scientists studying clouds (water
clouds not internet clouds) using computer simulations. They wrote and
documented a piece of software and they ended up publishing their program's
documentation in a scientific journal. It's already been sited and
everything. I hadn't even considered that as a possibility (publishing docs
as a scientific paper).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next two talks were pretty short (15 minute) talks about putting the data
where the users need it and an introduction to screen-casting. The first was
good for documenting things like an API and the second was good if I ever
need to make a screen-cast. I doubt that will happen, but you never know!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last talk &amp;quot;All roads might not lead to docs&amp;quot; held too main takeaways for
me: The quote &lt;em&gt;The Purpose of this document is ________&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://voiceandtone.com/"&gt;mailchimp
voice &amp;amp; tone guide&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very good document I suggest you read it
(the title is pretty self explanatory I think).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

schedule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The after party ended up happening at two venues since we got pre-maturely
kicked out of the first one; we made the best of it and I got to talk to Anna
Jaruga (the cloud research scientist) as well as a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/"&gt;Mozilla Development
Network&lt;/a&gt; writer, both very interesting people.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent most of today enjoying the Write the Docs talks and (air
conditioned) venue. I took some notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The keynote about the imposter syndrome was very relatable. The coping
mechanism of framing goals in &amp;quot;I want to do...&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;I want to be...&amp;quot;
seems like it could be effective. I liked the quote &amp;quot;Make better mistakes
tomorrow&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second talk about naming things was very good and got me to think about
the structure of documentation metadata (using labels vs taxonomy vs
thesaurus, etc). This will be useful someday I'm sure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third talk about [emojii] and the use of emoji was [emojii]. I
never considered using them before, but I will going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fourth talk mentioned using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_%28software%29?wprov=sfia1"&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; to test docs, that just makes
sense. It's so obvious I wish it was easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The API Docs talk mentioned that you should give your user the data they will
be working with as a top level priority instead of an after thought. This
will definitely be a priority for me. I already try to give plenty of
examples (since I speak example natively), but I'll be more Conscience of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Design Docs with Disability in Mind was interesting. The big takeaway for
me was keeping the elderly in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The meta talk about crafting a presentation was delivered very well and
mentioned adding contrast slide decks... I should have listened to this
advice...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second to the last talk of the day covered the plethora of rules we place
on documentation. Having just recently helped established some style guides
for the OSL docs I think we did a good job of giving some leeway to the
writers.  The extreme example of 'Limited rules docs' (e.g., the Python
Documentation) does not really work well for the reader in my experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final talk by some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/"&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt; writers equated docs to a garden.  The metaphor
worked surprisingly well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a full list of the talks and their descriptions, visit the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/schedule/"&gt;event's
schedule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1 was pretty emojii. We ended the night with emojii at a venue called The
Pub. Many conversations and laughs were had. I like this crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

Prague day 1 in which I meet the other speakers of Write the Docs EU 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I went on a wonderful &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/#events"&gt;city tour&lt;/a&gt; of Prague provided by Write The Docs. We
crossed some bridges, saw some castles, and experienced many wonderful parts of
the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="My dumb face and a delicious gelato." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/prague-gelato.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's me in front of a church eating some gelato.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tour I was very hungry and tagged along with some folks from my tour
group on a journey to get food. We went to a restaurant that brought us beer on
a model train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Choo choo. Here comes the beer train." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/prague-beer-train.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the train that brought us beer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some picture I took of the buildings in the city. I like the
architecture a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Classic architecture in the Prague city center." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/prague-city-center.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Even the small regular old streets in Prague are breathtaking." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/prague-street.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They are so cool. I haven't found the words to describe why, but the asthetics
please me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tour and food there was a &lt;em&gt;Write the Docs Conference Reception&lt;/em&gt; (aka
meet &amp;amp; greet) where I got to hang out with many of the attendees of the
conference. There was food and fabulous people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not have a hard time falling asleep that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I Strongly Dislike Travel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say I hate travel, but that level of hyperbole is literally the worst
thing on the planet...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My strong dislike for travel comes mostly from my personal inability to trust
the systems that will get me to where I am going. If I have a flight in one
week and I have to take a bus or train to the airport, I will spend the entire
week running through my head &amp;quot;When is my flight? Umm days, yeesh hours, and ack
minutes. How am I getting there? The oh God bus leaving at some time, somewhere
bound.  Once you get there you will go through security which will take between
5 minutes and 2 hours. Budget your time appropriately.  Any of these systems
can fail and based on experience they have&amp;quot; over and over and over. The stress
is compounded when people don't always speak your language and you forgot to
eat a proper meal the morning of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is why I am 3 hours early to my flight from Amsterdam to Prague. I
regret nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="currency-is-weird"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Currency is Weird&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="1 USD = 24.17 Czech Republic Koruna" class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/prague-conversion-rate.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is going to take me forever to remember &lt;em&gt;25 here monies is about 1 home
monies&lt;/em&gt;. Everything is gonna feel really expensive I bet...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-made-it-to-prague"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I Made it to Prague&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made it to Prague just fine. They have a cool train system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The MUSTEK stop in the Prague underground transit system. Very Soviet-era design." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/prague-mustek-stop.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way cooler than the underground train systems I'm used to...&lt;/p&gt;

I rent a bike and try to go all the way to the coast. It looked so much closer on the map...&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="section" id="my-butt-hurts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Butt Hurts...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went on an awesome bike ride all the way to Haarlem (15km west of
Amsterdam). I didn't actually do anything there; I just went, picked up snacks,
and headed back. I'm 99% sure I missed out on an awesome Haarlem exclusive
cultural experience, but if was really more about the journey (I originally set
out to bike to the coast and Haarlem was my compromise to that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="I don't recall where this park is exactly. I remember it was east of the city center, many kilometers." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/amsterdam-huge-park.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Another view of the park, this time with a play structure." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/amsterdam-huge-park-2.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I found a very neat park near the Western edge of Amsterdam; I ended
up spending an hour or so there having a picnic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dilapidated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="An old and dilapiddated building. It's hard to tell the building original purpose..." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/amserdam-dilapidated-building.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was a cool abandoned building I found. I like abandoned
buildings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="A large ice-cream cone shaped trashcan at a 45 degree angle for cyclists to dispose of trash into." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/amserdam-travelers-trash-can.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also found this awesome trash can for people riding bikes. It's
genius.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Ponies!" class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/amsterdam-ponies.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PONIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the bike ride I was very tired. I slept a lot. And yet not enough...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="small-and-large-appreciations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Small (and Large) Appreciations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of some of the traits of Amsterdam (and what I have experienced
of the Netherlands at large) which I appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have signs that tell you you're going the wrong direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can bike to another city and be on bike paths the whole time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bikes are easy to use and aren't shoe-horned in as a second class mode of
transportation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trains are so quiet. Why can't America have quiet trains?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list will probably grow as I remember things. All in all I like the city
and the country. You should visit if you haven't already.&lt;/p&gt;

I visit the Van Gough museum and to be completely honest, I am nonplussed.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I visited the Van Gough museum. I tried to get in using my mom's
Amsterdam Museum Pass, but it didn't fly there like it did at the Rijks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pretty fun, but the entire experience felt very artificial and plastic.
The paintings were great to see in person, but everything around the pieces
felt a little tacky. My opinion will likely change about it, but I did not
enjoy the Van Gough museum nearly as much as I enjoyed the Rijks Museum,
despite my love for Van Gough and his works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the day walking around and cashed in early. Jetlag + lots
of walking = ready for bed by 3pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Rijks Museum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="A panorama of an Amsterdam canal." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/amsterdam-canal.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm not sure which street I took this panorama on, but I think it looks
awesome. It captures the Amsterdam canal street pretty well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went to the Rijks Museum and had a bit of a culture overload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Chilling with the milk maid." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/amsterdam-milk-maid.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody got selfies with Van Gough, so I got a selfie The Milkmaid.  I
realize in retrospect that it doesn't work as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, this is my face when I realized the bathroom stalls go from
floor to ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Surprise and joy." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/amsterdam-all-the-way.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, this photo was taken in the bathroom stall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is a classy restaurant I found with classy lamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="A lamp with a cute switch." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/amsterdam-cute-lamp.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They were closed, otherwise I would have gone in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="some-travel-tips"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some Travel Tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have not completed my trip, I have some tips to share
with you about travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always bring a 'Go Bag' when you go out for the day. Fill it with snacks and
necessities and leave plenty of room for memorabilia you get while out and
about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try something new before defaulting to your comfort zone. This is true for
food as well as experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always being plenty of snacks and water. You will regret it if you don't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be patient. You invested a lot to get here, make it count.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At a museum, take a picture of the plackard after taking a picture of the
piece so you don't forget what it's called.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't be afraid to sit in a café and just read for a bit. Sometimes that's as
culturally diversifying as a day in a museum or city tour.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PDX -&amp;gt; AMS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight was uneventful. It was the longest one I've ever been on, which is
always a rough milestone to overcome, but actually one of the better flights
I've taken. TIL Delta's service does not suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually sleep the entire way to &amp;lt;insert location here&amp;gt;, but I managed to stay
productive (coding, reading, writing) for the majority of flight. I must say,
it was nice to have my own personal screen to catch up on Last Week Tonight.
I've wanted to watch that show for ages...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Lazy bliss not pictured&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="day-0-part-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 0: Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wrote down some thoughts about Amsterdam thus far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People keep using fake made up words. What's up with that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The roads are tiny but people keep driving on them. It looks like chaos but I
haven't seen an accident yet. I'm kinda impressed. People aren't even yelling
at each other about almost getting hit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The toilet paper squares are actually rectangles. It might just be the toilet
paper at the place I am staying. Either way, I can't deal with this aspect
ratio change. I might not be able to poop in Amsterdam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trains are so quiet. I didn't want to get off...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's some pictures I took:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Mostly trees and sky." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe2015/amsterdam-view.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The view from the location I am staying at.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Panorama of an Amsterdam park." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe2015/amsterdam-park-panorama.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A panorama from the park outside of where I am staying.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Goats!" class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe2015/amsterdam-goats.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some goats I found.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaaaaaaand naptime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="day-0-part-2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 0: Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished today by going to the Red Light District. There
were a lot of half naked ladies in windows. They kept winking
at me. I'm pretty sure they liked me; it's not like they
&lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; have a monetary incentive to get my attention or
anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up finding a bar and enjoying a Belgian White Beer.
It tasted &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://xkcd.com/1534/"&gt;surprisingly good&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="A Belgium white beer." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe2015/amsterdam-beer.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So this is what it feels like to drink in a bar... neat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="section" id="all-packed"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All Packed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm all packed up and ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Three weeks of supplies neatly displayed on a pink bed." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/packed.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left:&lt;/strong&gt; Chargers, electronics, entertainment, toiletries, water bottle,
wallet, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Center:&lt;/strong&gt; The bag, the &lt;em&gt;Write the Docs&lt;/em&gt; shirt I'll be wearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right:&lt;/strong&gt; Clothing. Gameboy SP at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; bag of things to bring to Europe, but certainly solid and
most of it practical. I'm packing an extra bag for all of the trinkets I'll
bring back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you want anything (if you know how to contact me we're close
enough for you to ask.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Starting the travel blog strong.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This blog was created in preparation for my trip to Europe in about 3 weeks. I
wanted to see how difficult it would be to make a blog that could be updated on
the go, version controlled with git, and would not require me to log into a
laptop or server to make changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up using PageUp (link in the footer), along with Github Gists (also
linked in the footer) to make a mostly useful platform. New changes are pushed
to Github, my personal server pulls those changes every 10 minutes, and this
page is rebuilt pretty painlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of all: with a git client on my phone I can make updates anywhere that has
a signal and I don't need to bust my laptop out. I wrote this post while I was
on the toilet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't as easy as using an established platform like Twitter, but just like
with everything I try to make, I put something together I would want to use and
interact with. If a friend started a liveblog for a specific event I would
follow it over their Twitter feed any day. Plus I don't have to deal with the
character limit of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
