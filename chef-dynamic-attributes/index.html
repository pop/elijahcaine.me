  <p>So you want to set a node attribute in a resource block?
Good luck --
oh wait you don't need luck because you have this blogpost!</p>
<div class="section" id="problem">
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>You are trying to set a node attribute in a resource block but it isn't working.</p>
<p>For example you have the following code:</p>
<pre class="code ruby literal-block">
<span class="n">ruby_block</span> <span class="s1">'foo'</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">block</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="c1"># some ruby</span>
    <span class="n">node</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">override</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">'var'</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'value'</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="n">action</span> <span class="ss">:run</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">node</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">'var'</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">'value'</span>
  <span class="n">notifies</span> <span class="ss">:run</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">some_resource</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
  <span class="n">notifies</span> <span class="ss">:run</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">other_resource</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">whatever</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre>
<p>Even though you're setting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">node['var']</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">other_resource[whatever]</tt> is getting notified to <tt class="docutils literal">:run</tt>.
What gives?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="solution">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>To jump ahead, because you're skimming this post for the answer, you're going to want to do something like this:</p>
<pre class="code diff literal-block">
# go-go-gadget diffs
# Chef Version 13.5.8

  ruby_block 'foo' do
    block do
      # some ruby
      node.override['var'] = 'value'
    end
<span class="gd">-   action :run
</span><span class="gi">+   action :nothing
</span><span class="gd">- end
</span><span class="gi">+ end.run_action(:run)
</span>
if node['var'] == 'value'
  notifies :run, some_resource[name]
else
  notifies :run, other_resource[whatever]
end
</pre>
<p>Basically you want to execute the <tt class="docutils literal">ruby_block</tt> that sets your attribute <strong>now</strong> so the rest of your code can consume the value either later in the compilation phase or during the execution phase of the Chef run.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-why-did-that-work">
<h2>How/why did that work?</h2>
<p>If you've read his far you're actually reading.
Welcome to the post!
Let's begin.</p>
<p>Let's dig into <em>exactly</em> what my problem was, because sometimes examples aren't good enough.
You know... for fun.</p>
<p>I was trying to trigger an application upgrade based on the current installed version.
I was <em>not</em> installing a package-manager-managed package <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id1">[2]</a> so I couldn't just pin the version a <tt class="docutils literal">yum</tt> resource, I had to do this kludge of a solution.</p>
<p>So for me <tt class="docutils literal">some_resource[name]</tt> was downloading the latest version of the app (a <tt class="docutils literal">.tar.gz2</tt> file from GitHub) and <tt class="docutils literal">other_resource[whatever]</tt> was a no-op.
The as part of the package download I unconditionally trigger a <tt class="docutils literal">:delayed</tt> service restart.
Chef was 'upgrading' and restarting my app every thirty minutes which broke core functionality. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id2">[1]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="shit-i-tried-before-stumbling-upon-the-solution">
<h2>Shit I tried before stumbling upon the solution</h2>
<p>I tried a bunch of things, but they can all kinda be summed up in this:</p>
<pre class="code diff literal-block">
# yay more diffs
  ruby_block 'foo' do
    block do
      # some ruby
      node.override['var'] = 'value'
    end
    notifies :create, 'tar[my-app]', :immediately # Triggers tar[my-app] to run now
  end

<span class="gd">- if node['var'] == 'value'
-   notify :run, some_resource[name]
- else
-   notify :run, other_resource[whatever]
- end
</span>
  tar 'my-app' do
    action  :nothing # Unless triggered this does nothing
<span class="gi">+   only_if { node['var'] == 'value' } # This should also do nothing if this isn't true
</span>    # The rest of the resource block
  end
</pre>
<p>Which ultimately didn't work either.</p>
<p>I... I have no idea why this didn't work.</p>
<p>Something something Chef is complicated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-the-solution-works-and-the-other-stuff-didn-t">
<h2>Why the solution works (and the other stuff didn't)</h2>
<p>The reason my ultimate solution <em>did</em> work is best summed up by this quote from the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.chef.io/resource_common.html#run-action">Chef Docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.run_action(:some_action)</span></tt> at the end of a resource block to run the specified action during the compile phase.</blockquote>
<p>My original code (read: broken code) was running the <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> block during the compilation phase (happens earlier) and running the <tt class="docutils literal">ruby_block</tt> in the execution phase (happens later).
By telling it to run my <tt class="docutils literal">ruby_block</tt> during the compilation phase we were ensuring it happened before the <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> block, and in a way running it like you would 'expect' a script to run.</p>
<p>It ain't idiomatic but it gets the job done.</p>
