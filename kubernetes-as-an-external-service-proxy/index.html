  <p>Say you have a firewall restriction that creates the following situation:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>App1 cannot communicate directly with App2.</li>
<li>App1 and App2 can both talk to a Kubernets cluster.</li>
<li>Neither app is hosted on the Kubernetes cluster.</li>
<li>How can you get messages between App1 and App2?</li>
</ol>
<p>The way the problem is stated makes it pretty obvious that the solution <em>involves</em> using a Kubernetes cluster, but how exactly?</p>
<p>The naive solution might be to spin up a container which acts as a proxy; Nginx comes to mind.
This would definitely work, but I am exceedingly lazy and don't want to learn how to configure Nginx.
In fact, the solution I came to doesn't involve running any new pods!</p>
<p>Here's the code.
Below I'll explain what's happening here and why it works.</p>

<div class="section" id="endpoints">
<h2>Endpoints</h2>
<p>Endpoints are the Kubernetes abstraction for IPs+Ports running the same application.
It's how you group together N instances of an app into one pool.</p>
<p>Under the hood Endpoints get created as a pre-requisite for every Service you deploy.
You don't usually need to deal with these directly as they are created implicitly whenever a Deployment gets applied.</p>
<p>By manually creating an endpoint we have imported our non-kubernetes app into Kubernetes.
That means we can do Kubernetes things with it like expose it via a Service or even put it behind an Ingress
Pretty neat!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="service">
<h2>Service</h2>
<p>Services are how we expose an endpoint to the world.
Most cloud providers will give you a public IP address for a service and load balance across all of that service's endpoints.</p>
<p>This is as far as we need to proxy traffic between our two Apps.
App1 makes a request to whatever IP Kubernetes gets for the <cite>myapp-proxy</cite> Service and relays it to the <cite>myapp-proxy</cite> endpoint, which ultimately routes the traffic to App2.
What's really cool is that the endpoint that <strong>is</strong> App2 can be an self-hosted Virtual Machine, as long as the IP doesn't change this proxy will continue to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ingress">
<h2>Ingress</h2>
<p>Ingresses are my favorite part of Kubernetes.
They're very convenient, incredibly powerful, and they work like... over half the time.</p>
<p>While not strictly necessary, this Ingress gives us some nice-to-haves.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Gives us an easy to manage host name via something like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-dns">External DNS</a>.</li>
<li>Could be extended to terminate SSL, again &quot;for free&quot;, with something like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager">Cert Manager</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's how we use Kubernetes to manage services (lower-case 's') which aren't running in Pods.</p>
