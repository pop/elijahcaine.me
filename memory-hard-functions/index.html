<div class="section" id="problem-storing-passwords-is-hard">
<h2>Problem: storing passwords is hard</h2>
<p>You're a system administrator and -- oh no!
A hacker stole your database!</p>
<p>Well, not yet... but they <em>could</em>.
Once you get popular enough it's bound to happen. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id19" id="id1">[9]</a>
Can you make sure your users data is safe <strong>when</strong> that happens?</p>
<p>When you store passwords in a database you never store them in plain text.
Instead, you store a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">hash</a> of that password.
For example:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
Password: 12345678
sha256sum (hash): 2634c3097f98e36865f0c572009c4ffd73316bc8b88ccfe8d196af35f46e2394
</pre>
<p>The hash is generated when the user tries to login.
The <em>hash</em> of the password the user sends at login is compared against the corresponding password hash for that user.
If it matches that means the user sent the right password and so they are authenticated.</p>
<p>What happens if the hacker pre-computes a bunch of popular passwords?
This might sound crazy, but there are lots of people that re-use passwords, like <tt class="docutils literal">123456</tt>.
The hacker can pre-compute the hash for the 1,000,000 most popular passwords and more or less reverse-search for any user's password once they have a database dump.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="solution-1-add-salt">
<h2>Solution 1: add salt</h2>
<p>Our first naive solution to solve this problem is to make the adversary's life harder by adding <em>salt</em> to our passwords.
This is a piece of known information which is added to the password so adversaries can't pre-compute a hash-table, they have to compute this after they have the database and figure out the salt.
For example:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
Password: 12345678
Salt: cryptoHeckYeah!
New Password: 12345678cryptoHeckYeah!
sha256sum: 6e8a7780df48a0b687e9e272e8d082f5f4c0c3a8c43b63461c3f62618b111e9d
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately we live in 2017 and Graphics processors and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">ASICs</a> are cheap and can compute sha256sums <strong>super fast</strong> for <strong>really cheap</strong>.
This means that it might be more of a pain, but the adversary can still crack a password with relative ease and efficiency because they've got a computer <em>designed</em> to generate lots of hashes.
Curses.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="solution-2-h-h-h-x">
<h2>Solution 2: H(H(..H(x)..)</h2>
<p>Computing a single sha256sum is easy, but what if the hacker had to compute like... 1000 sha256sums for each password!
That sounds pretty hard... right?
If we compute the hash of the hash of the hash (etc) it would take like... 1000x longer to compute each user's password.
Something like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
p = '12345678cryptoHeckYeah!'
for x in 1..1000
  p = sha256sum( p )
end
return p

Result: 47c76630def739ede9c05fd974065b1200d4712aa2421eefb1f6b241a1ca6bea
Time: 0m1.547s
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately this hurts more than it helps.</p>
<p>In bash on non-specialized hardware, this took about 1.6 seconds.
On specialized hardware, written in a systems programming language, and implemented in parallel it'd be much less costly for an adversary to crack passwords hashed this way.</p>
<p>Worst of all, this is <em>easier for an adversary to compute than it is for the the &quot;good guys&quot;</em> because the non-malicious actor is using generalized hardware and the adversary is using specialized hardware to compute the hashes.
It's like trying to beat a Roadster in a drag race when you're behind the wheel of a Minivan; the Minivan (&quot;good guys&quot;) <em>can't win</em> because they weren't built for drag races.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="solution-3-memory-hard-functions">
<h2>Solution 3: Memory Hard Functions</h2>
<p>The big problem we have is that CPUs can be specialized to crack passwords <em>very quickly</em>.
No matter how fast your AWS EC2 instance is, or even that top of the line IBM server you just bought, it will <em>never</em> be faster than a cheap custom designed ASIC.
At around 3000$/box it won't break the adversary's bank to break into yours. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id20" id="id2">[10]</a></p>
<p>While there specialized hash-cracking CPUs <strong>do</strong> exist, specialized hash-cracking <em>memory</em> does <strong>not</strong> exist. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id17" id="id3">[7]</a>
If we were to create an algorithm which depends on lots of memory, instead of lots of CPU cycles, we could &quot;level the playing field&quot;.
This should help stop adversaries from reversing passwords as fast as they currently can.</p>
<p>This theoretical hash-function is called a Memory Hard Function (MHF).
These are difficult to perform unless you have a certain threshold of memory.
As a result non-malicious actors can perform a hash in M seconds and it will take a malicious actor <em>at least</em> M seconds to perform the same hash.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">TLDR: We want a hash function that takes as long for an adversary to compute as it does for the &quot;good guys&quot; to compute.
Since nobody has specialized hash-cracking RAM we should be able to create a hash function which is memory-intensive and fits our criteria.
If we have a function that fits this we will have got a <em>Memory hard Function</em> (MHF).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scrypt-a-wild-mhf">
<h2>scrypt: a wild MHF</h2>
<p>scrpyt is a key derivation function <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html">developed for the Tarsnap project</a>.
It was designed explicitly to solve this problem and has some pretty impressive results.
Some especially impressive results include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>scrypt is about 2<sup>5</sup> times more expensive to attack for logins than bcrypt.</li>
<li>scrypt is about 2<sup>15</sup> times more espensive to attack for logins than MD5 CRYPT.</li>
<li>scrypt is about 2<sup>37</sup> times more expensive to attack for file encryption than MD5.</li>
</ul>
<p>scrypt also happens to be a MHF.
Yay we found one!</p>
<p>So... how does it work?</p>
<p>Given a hash function H, an input B, and an integer N, compute:</p>
<blockquote>
V<sub>i</sub> = H<sup>i</sup>(B), given 0 ≤ i &lt; N,</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
X = H<sup>N</sup>(B)</blockquote>
<p>then iterate</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>j &lt;- Integrify(X) mod N</li>
<li>X &lt;- H(X ⊕ V<sub>j</sub>)</li>
</ul>
<p>N times; and output X</p>
<p>The function Integrify can be any bijection <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id18" id="id4">[8]</a> from {0,1}<sup>k</sup> to {0...2<sup>k</sup> - 1}.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Breaking that down a bit:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The function is given a different hash function (H), an input to compute the hash of (B), and a modulus (N).</li>
<li>N hashes are generated with variations of H and the input B called V<sub>0..N</sub>.</li>
<li>X is initialized with a hash value and a loop begins:<ol class="arabic">
<li>j is set to a psuedo-random integer mod N.</li>
<li>X is set to the hash of the existing X value xor'd with one of the V values.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Loop N times and output the final X.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the biggest gripes with scrypt is that it has a very predictable runtime.
This means that the running of the function is predictable based on the user's input and so can be victim to a cache-timing side-channel attack.
We won't be able to get into what this attack means, but basically you can say &quot;scrypt is good, but not perfect&quot;.</p>

<div class="section" id="data-independent-mhfs-imhfs">
<h2>Data-independent MHFs (iMHFs)</h2>
<img alt="A directed acyclic graph map." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/independent-crypto/DAG.gif" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>iMHFs are supposed to solve the problem that scrypt has (side-channel attacks) by have unpredictable runtimes which still result in the same output.</p>
<p>iMHFs can be thought of as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) which are traversed during runtime.</p>
<p>Some specifics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The function depends on a random oracle H: {0,1}<sup>2k</sup> -&gt; {0,1}<sup>k</sup></li>
<li>The function provides a Directed Acyclic Graph Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) G used to encode data-dependencies</li>
<li>The initial input is a password and a salt.</li>
<li>Each other node is labeled with the hash of it's parent nodes.</li>
<li>The output is the hash of the value of the last node.</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned before, a very nice feature of iMHFs is that their memory usage pattern does not depend on the user's input (password) and so is not vulnerable to side-channel attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pebbling-a-directed-acyclic-graph-dag">
<h2>Pebbling a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</h2>
<img alt="A directed acyclic graph traversal." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/independent-crypto/dag-animated.gif" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>We can think of the process of computing the output of an iMHF as pebbling a graph where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Computing the value of a node is to pebble it.</li>
<li>There are rules about which nodes can be pebbled at any time.</li>
<li>When a pebble is removed from a node it is freed from memory.</li>
<li>Our goal is to pebble the last node.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rules:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We can only place a pebble on a node if we have pebbles on all of it's parents nodes.</li>
<li>Our goal is to get to the sink node (exit node).</li>
</ul>
<p>The naive pebbling algorithm, the one the 'good guy' user would utilize is as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Only one pebble can be placed per time-step.</li>
<li>The graph is pebbled in in topological order.</li>
<li>Pebbles (calculated nodes) are never discarded until the end of the function.</li>
<li>Expected cost: scales with n<sup>2</sup> where n is the number of nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This does take up considerable resources, but it isn't prohibitive for users on commodity hardware.
This means it won't take <em>too long</em> to get your account authenticated.
More importantly, it will take about as long for the bad guys to calculate a token as it took you to calculate a token, as opposed to a small fraction it would take if this was a &quot;normal&quot; hash function.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attacks-on-imhfs">
<h2>Attacks on iMHFs</h2>
<p>An attack is defined as when cost of calculating a hash from an iMHF is lower than via the nieve approach.</p>
<p>The general idea of an iMHF attack is that it has two phases: light phase and balloon phase.</p>
<div class="section" id="light-phase">
<h3>Light Phase</h3>
<p>In the light phase the algorithm races through the DAG discarding as many pebbles as possible, essentially performing a breadth first search for the end of the graph, computing nodes in parallel when possible.
Once a node is computed and it isn't immediately needed it is discarded.</p>
<p>If the DAG were a straight line from beginning to end this would be fairly memory efficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="balloon-phase">
<h3>Balloon Phase</h3>
<p>In the balloon phase the algorithm has 'hit a wall' and back-computes the nodes it needs to compute the next node whose parent's have already been discarded.
This causes a slow-down.</p>
<p>An attack described like this has the following complexity:</p>
<blockquote>
E<sub>R</sub>(A) = O(en + √(n<sup>3</sup>d))</blockquote>
<p>For small values of e and d this results in an attack as:</p>
<blockquote>
E<sub>R</sub>(A) = O(n<sup>2</sup>) for e,d = O(n)</blockquote>
<p>Preventing against this type of attack is where much of the research into iMHF's is focused.
An ideal iMHF DAG minimize the disparity between the attackers compute time and the &quot;good guy's&quot; compute time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This has been a rough overview of Memory Hard functions, how they work, and how variations of MHFs differ.</p>
<p>MHFs are functions which remove the advantage that adversaries have to crack passwords by depending heavily on memory.
This reduces the adversary's advantage if they have an ASIC or GPU processor(s) to brute-force a password crack and ought to make it very difficult (ideally <em>impractical</em>) for adversaries to crack a password hashed with an MHF.</p>
<p>Some existing MHFs, like scrypt, are vulnerable to side-channel attacks so iMHFs have been theorized which do not have a predictable runtime and so are not vulnerable to side-channel attacks.
No iMHFs exist yet, however many functions have been developed with get <em>close</em> and offer many of the benefits of iMFHs.
Some of these include Argon2i, Catena, and Balloon hashing, which we did not cover in this post.</p>
