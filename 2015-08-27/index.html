  <p>Today I visited the Van Gough museum. I tried to get in using my mom's
Amsterdam Museum Pass, but it didn't fly there like it did at the Rijks.</p>
<p>It was pretty fun, but the entire experience felt very artificial and plastic.
The paintings were great to see in person, but everything around the pieces
felt a little tacky. My opinion will likely change about it, but I did not
enjoy the Van Gough museum nearly as much as I enjoyed the Rijks Museum,
despite my love for Van Gough and his works.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the day walking around and cashed in early. Jetlag + lots
of walking = ready for bed by 3pm.</p>
