  <p>This blog was created in preparation for my trip to Europe in about 3 weeks. I
wanted to see how difficult it would be to make a blog that could be updated on
the go, version controlled with git, and would not require me to log into a
laptop or server to make changes.</p>
<p>I ended up using PageUp (link in the footer), along with Github Gists (also
linked in the footer) to make a mostly useful platform. New changes are pushed
to Github, my personal server pulls those changes every 10 minutes, and this
page is rebuilt pretty painlessly.</p>
<p>Best of all: with a git client on my phone I can make updates anywhere that has
a signal and I don't need to bust my laptop out. I wrote this post while I was
on the toilet!</p>
<p>It wasn't as easy as using an established platform like Twitter, but just like
with everything I try to make, I put something together I would want to use and
interact with. If a friend started a liveblog for a specific event I would
follow it over their Twitter feed any day. Plus I don't have to deal with the
character limit of Twitter.</p>
