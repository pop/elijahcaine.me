  <p>I went on a wonderful <a class="reference external" href="http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/#events">city tour</a> of Prague provided by Write The Docs. We
crossed some bridges, saw some castles, and experienced many wonderful parts of
the city.</p>

<p><em>Here's me in front of a church eating some gelato.</em></p>
<p>After the tour I was very hungry and tagged along with some folks from my tour
group on a journey to get food. We went to a restaurant that brought us beer on
a model train.</p>
<img alt="Choo choo. Here comes the beer train." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/prague-beer-train.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p><em>This is the train that brought us beer.</em></p>
<p>Here are some picture I took of the buildings in the city. I like the
architecture a lot.</p>

<img alt="Even the small regular old streets in Prague are breathtaking." class="align-center" src="/assets/images/europe-2015/prague-street.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p><em>They are so cool. I haven't found the words to describe why, but the asthetics
please me.</em></p>
<p>After the tour and food there was a <em>Write the Docs Conference Reception</em> (aka
meet &amp; greet) where I got to hang out with many of the attendees of the
conference. There was food and fabulous people.</p>
<p>I did not have a hard time falling asleep that night.</p>
