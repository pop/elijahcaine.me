<h2>I Strongly Dislike Travel</h2>
<p>I would say I hate travel, but that level of hyperbole is literally the worst
thing on the planet...</p>
<p>My strong dislike for travel comes mostly from my personal inability to trust
the systems that will get me to where I am going. If I have a flight in one
week and I have to take a bus or train to the airport, I will spend the entire
week running through my head &quot;When is my flight? Umm days, yeesh hours, and ack
minutes. How am I getting there? The oh God bus leaving at some time, somewhere
bound.  Once you get there you will go through security which will take between
5 minutes and 2 hours. Budget your time appropriately.  Any of these systems
can fail and based on experience they have&quot; over and over and over. The stress
is compounded when people don't always speak your language and you forgot to
eat a proper meal the morning of.</p>
<p><em>That</em> is why I am 3 hours early to my flight from Amsterdam to Prague. I
regret nothing.</p>

<p>It is going to take me forever to remember <em>25 here monies is about 1 home
monies</em>. Everything is gonna feel really expensive I bet...</p>

<h2>I Made it to Prague</h2>
<p>I made it to Prague just fine. They have a cool train system.</p>
