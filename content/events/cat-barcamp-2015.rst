:tags: Cat Barcamp, Talks, PSU CAT

This weekend I went to `Cat Barcamp 2015`_, an unconference run by the PSU
`Computer Action Team`_. I went to some awesome talks (and gave one myself).

I enjoyed every talk I went to. Here they are in order:

#. **History of Cryptography.**
    This was given by one of my OSL co-workers. It didn't contain a ton of new
    information for me, but was delivered very well and focused on different
    types of cryptography and the context in which each one was developed. I
    enjoyed it.
#. **Haskell on Steroids.**
    I kinda checked out during this talk because I wanted to write my slides...
    Wooops. It looked very interesting and mathey though...
#. **Introduction to Test Driven Development in Power Shell.**
    Whoa Windows! (actually though, I learned more about Power Shell than I
    ever expected to know).
#. **MY TALK.**
    `(see below)`_
#. **A Whirlwind Tour of Lojban.**
    Lojban seems like a cool language. Corbin (previous LUG president) gave
    this talk, he's a cool guy... you might even say he's TheMostAwesomeDude.
#. **Adventures in IT Security: Then and now.**
    I like history. I also like computers. This was a good talk. I am biased.
#. **Talking to people! (or, How I learned to stop worrying and love the user.)**
    Spoiler: The secret is understanding social cues.

My Talk
-------

I decided on the spur of the moment to give a talk 'How to Write a (very
mediocre) Static Site Generator' and with only 40 minutes of prep work I was
able to fill an hour pretty well.

Here are some links from that:

- The `demo code`_.
- The `abomination of a website`_ we built between the demo and the end of the
  session (epilepsy warning... no seriously).
- The `very sparse slides`_.

TLDR
----

The CAT is an awesome group of people. I'm glad I was able to get a few LUG
members to come to the event. If I went to PSU I would be honored to work with
the CAT. They throw a hellofan event.
