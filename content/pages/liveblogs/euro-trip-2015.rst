Euro-trip Well-After-The-Fact Blog
==================================

`My`_ little liveblog / travelblog thing, covering everything 
leading up to and including my trip to Amsterdam and Prague to 
speak at `Write the Docs - Europe`_.

Please excuse the spelling errors, English is only my first 
language.

Oldest posts are at the bottom, newer posts are at the top.

\* Well-After-The-Fact = It was originally a liveblog, then a live(ish) blog,
then I took two weeks off to write the last three days worth of posts --
basically I'm just glad I was able to stick with it to the end, even if it was
a bit delayed getting finished.

.. note::

    Posts for this liveblog have ceased. Keep an eye out for my next trip when
    I will try my hand at live-blogging again :)

About the blog (this is a test)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This blog was created in preparation for my trip to Europe in about 3 weeks. I
wanted to see how difficult it would be to make a blog that could be updated on
the go, version controlled with git, and would not require me to log into a
laptop or server to make changes.

I ended up using PageUp (link in the footer), along with Github Gists (also
linked in the footer) to make a mostly useful platform. New changes are pushed
to Github, my personal server pulls those changes every 10 minutes, and this
page is rebuilt pretty painlessly.

Best of all: with a git client on my phone I can make updates anywhere that has
a signal and I don't need to bust my laptop out. I wrote this post while I was
on the toilet!

It wasn't as easy as using an established platform like Twitter, but just like
with everything I try to make, I put something together I would want to use and
interact with. If a friend started a liveblog for a specific event I would
follow it over their Twitter feed any day. Plus I don't have to deal with the
character limit of Twitter.

All of my travel is booked, plane tickets are bought, and vacation time gotten.

The only thing left to do now is to write the talk. Easy-peasy.

All Packed
~~~~~~~~~~

So I'm all packed up and ready to go.

**Left:** Chargers, electronics, entertainment, toiletries, water bottle,
wallet, etc.

**Center:** The bag, the *Write the Docs* shirt I'll be wearing.

**Right:** Clothing. Gameboy SP at the top.

Not the *perfect* bag of things to bring to Europe, but certainly solid and
most of it practical. I'm packing an extra bag for all of the trinkets I'll
bring back.

Let me know if you want anything (if you know how to contact me we're close
enough for you to ask.)

PDX -> AMS
~~~~~~~~~~

The flight was uneventful. It was the longest one I've ever been on, which is
always a rough milestone to overcome, but actually one of the better flights
I've taken. TIL Delta's service does not suck.

I usually sleep the entire way to <insert location here>, but I managed to stay
productive (coding, reading, writing) for the majority of flight. I must say,
it was nice to have my own personal screen to catch up on Last Week Tonight.
I've wanted to watch that show for ages...

[*Lazy bliss not pictured*]

So good.

Day 0: Part 1 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

So I wrote down some thoughts about Amsterdam thus far: 

* People keep using fake made up words. What's up with that? 
* The roads are tiny but people keep driving on them. It looks like chaos but I
  haven't seen an accident yet. I'm kinda impressed. People aren't even yelling
  at each other about almost getting hit. 
* The toilet paper squares are actually rectangles. It might just be the toilet
  paper at the place I am staying. Either way, I can't deal with this aspect
  ratio change. I might not be able to poop in Amsterdam. 
* **COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE**
* The trains are so quiet. I didn't want to get off... 
* **BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES**

Here's some pictures I took:

Aaaaaaaand naptime. 

Day 0: Part 2 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

I finished today by going to the Red Light District. There 
were a lot of half naked ladies in windows. They kept winking 
at me. I'm pretty sure they liked me; it's not like they 
*definitely* have a monetary incentive to get my attention or 
anything.

I ended up finding a bar and enjoying a Belgian White Beer. 
It tasted `surprisingly good`_

*So this is what it feels like to drink in a bar... neat.*

The Rijks Museum 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*I'm not sure which street I took this panorama on, but I think it looks
awesome. It captures the Amsterdam canal street pretty well.*

Today I went to the Rijks Museum and had a bit of a culture overload. 

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/Ic9NAY1.jpg

    :width: 100% 

Everybody got selfies with Van Gough, so I got a selfie The Milkmaid.  I
realize in retrospect that it doesn't work as well. 

In other news, this is my face when I realized the bathroom stalls go from
floor to ceiling. 

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/EI3v0DS.jpg

*Yes, this photo was taken in the bathroom stall.*

And this is a classy restaurant I found with classy lamps.

*They were closed, otherwise I would have gone in.*

Some Travel Tips 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Although I have not completed my trip, I have some tips to share 
with you about travel. 

* Always bring a 'Go Bag' when you go out for the day. Fill it with snacks and
  necessities and leave plenty of room for memorabilia you get while out and
  about. 
* Try something new before defaulting to your comfort zone. This is true for
  food as well as experiences. 
* Always being plenty of snacks and water. You will regret it if you don't. 
* Be patient. You invested a lot to get here, make it count. 
* At a museum, take a picture of the plackard after taking a picture of the
  piece so you don't forget what it's called. 
* Don't be afraid to sit in a cafÈ and just read for a bit. Sometimes that's as
  culturally diversifying as a day in a museum or city tour.

Thursday 2015-08-27
-------------------

Today I visited the Van Gough museum. I tried to get in using my mom's
Amsterdam Museum Pass, but it didn't fly there like it did at the Rijks. 

It was pretty fun, but the entire experience felt very artificial and plastic.
The paintings were great to see in person, but everything around the pieces
felt a little tacky. My opinion will likely change about it, but I did not
enjoy the Van Gough museum nearly as much as I enjoyed the Rijks Museum,
despite my love for Van Gough and his works. 

I spent the rest of the day walking around and cashed in early. Jetlag + lots
of walking = ready for bed by 3pm.

My Butt Hurts... 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Today I went on an awesome bike ride all the way to Haarlem (15km west of
Amsterdam). I didn't actually do anything there; I just went, picked up snacks,
and headed back. I'm 99% sure I missed out on an awesome Haarlem exclusive
cultural experience, but if was really more about the journey (I originally set
out to bike to the coast and Haarlem was my compromise to that).

up spending an hour or so there having a picnic.*

buildings.*

genius.*

*PONIES*

After the bike ride I was very tired. I slept a lot. And yet not enough... 

Small (and Large) Appreciations 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a list of some of the traits of Amsterdam (and what I have experienced
of the Netherlands at large) which I appreciate. 

* They have signs that tell you you're going the wrong direction. 
* You can bike to another city and be on bike paths the whole time! 
* Bikes are easy to use and aren't shoe-horned in as a second class mode of
  transportation. 
* The trains are so quiet. Why can't America have quiet trains? 

This list will probably grow as I remember things. All in all I like the city
and the country. You should visit if you haven't already.

I Strongly Dislike Travel 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

I would say I hate travel, but that level of hyperbole is literally the worst
thing on the planet... 

My strong dislike for travel comes mostly from my personal inability to trust
the systems that will get me to where I am going. If I have a flight in one
week and I have to take a bus or train to the airport, I will spend the entire
week running through my head "When is my flight? Umm days, yeesh hours, and ack
minutes. How am I getting there? The oh God bus leaving at some time, somewhere
bound.  Once you get there you will go through security which will take between
5 minutes and 2 hours. Budget your time appropriately.  Any of these systems
can fail and based on experience they have" over and over and over. The stress
is compounded when people don't always speak your language and you forgot to
eat a proper meal the morning of. 

*That* is why I am 3 hours early to my flight from Amsterdam to Prague. I
regret nothing. 

Currency is Weird

It is going to take me forever to remember *25 here monies is about 1 home
monies*. Everything is gonna feel really expensive I bet... 

I Made it to Prague
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I made it to Prague just fine. They have a cool train system.

Way cooler than the underground train systems I'm used to...

Prague Day 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~

I went on a wonderful `city tour`_ of Prague provided by Write The Docs. We
crossed some bridges, saw some castles, and experienced many wonderful parts of
the city.

    :width: 100%

*Here's me in front of a church eating some gelato.*

After the tour I was very hungry and tagged along with some folks from my tour
group on a journey to get food. We went to a restaurant that brought us beer on
a model train.

    :width: 100%

*This is the train that brought us beer.*

Here are some picture I took of the buildings in the city. I like the
architecture a lot.

*They are so cool. I haven't found the words to describe why, but the asthetics
please me.*

After the tour and food there was a *Write the Docs Conference Reception* (aka
meet & greet) where I got to hang out with many of the attendees of the
conference. There was food and fabulous people.

I did not have a hard time falling asleep that night.

Write the Docs: Day 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I spent most of today enjoying the Write the Docs talks and (air 
conditioned) venue. I took some notes. 

* The keynote about the imposter syndrome was very relatable. The coping
  mechanism of framing goals in "I want to do..." instead of "I want to be..."
  seems like it could be effective. I liked the quote "Make better mistakes
  tomorrow". 
* The second talk about naming things was very good and got me to think about
  the structure of documentation metadata (using labels vs taxonomy vs
  thesaurus, etc). This will be useful someday I'm sure. 
* The third talk about üé® and the use of emoji was üëå. I never considered using
  them before, but I will going forward. 
* The fourth talk mentioned using `Selenium`_ to test docs, that just makes
  sense. It's so obvious I wish it was easier. 
* The API Docs talk mentioned that you should give your user the data they will
  be working with as a top level priority instead of an after thought. This
  will definitely be a priority for me. I already try to give plenty of
  examples (since I speak example natively), but I'll be more Conscience of it. 
* The Design Docs with Disability in Mind was interesting. The big takeaway for
  me was keeping the elderly in mind. 
* The meta talk about crafting a presentation was delivered very well and
  mentioned adding contrast slide decks... I should have listened to this
  advice... 
* The second to the last talk of the day covered the plethora of rules we place
  on documentation. Having just recently helped established some style guides
  for the OSL docs I think we did a good job of giving some leeway to the
  writers.  The extreme example of 'Limited rules docs' (e.g., the Python
  Documentation) does not really work well for the reader in my experience. 
* The final talk by some `MDN`_ writers equated docs to a garden.  The metaphor
  worked surprisingly well. 

For a full list of the talks and their descriptions, visit the `event's
schedule`_. 

Day 1 was pretty üëç. We ended the night with üçª at a venue called The Pub. Many
conversations and laughs were had. I like this crowd.

Write the Docs: Day 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just like yesterday, I spent most of today enjoying some wonderful talks as
well as stressing out -- I mean totally not stressing out -- about my own talk.

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/CeB82W5.jpg
    :alt: Write the Docs Staff Picture
    :width: 100%

The Write the Docs Staff saying thanks.

* The first talk of the day was titled "Judas Priest Ate My Scrum Master",
  which has almost nothing to do with Judas Priest or eating or scrum masters;
  instead it talked about things that are well known issues and a lot of laws
  (`Brooks' Law`_, `Lehmann's Laws`_, `Pareto Principle`_, `Conway's Law`_,
  etc) that nobody talks about that much but can be super helpful to consider
  when working in an industry.
* The second talk covered different types of user interfaces and what to
  consider when writing error messages, troubleshooting pages, product tours.
  It was something I hadn't considered having primarily written command line
  tools with pretty limited and well established interface guidelines.
* Then I gave a talk. It was a talk. I'll post a video of it once those
  get put up online and you can decide if it was good or bad.
* The talk after mine was a nice history lesson and wanted the audience to
  reflect on what documentations can learn from documentation practices of the
  past. The TLDR on that one is that it used to suck to write technical docs
  even more than it sucks now.
* Then there were a bunch of lightning talks. One talk from a twitter employee
  (there's a fun name for them I'm sure) mentioned that gathering metrics are
  is important because without metrics everything you do is just guess and
  check.
* The next talk "MacGyvering your docs" brought up the fact that the best
  documentation toolchain will (should?) only help existing developers. A
  better toolchain won't attract new devs. That was something I think a lot of
  projects can lose sight of.
* The talk after that covered a team of scientists studying clouds (water
  clouds not internet clouds) using computer simulations. They wrote and
  documented a piece of software and they ended up publishing their program's
  documentation in a scientific journal. It's already been sited and
  everything. I hadn't even considered that as a possibility (publishing docs
  as a scientific paper).
* The next two talks were pretty short (15 minute) talks about putting the data
  where the users need it and an introduction to screen-casting. The first was
  good for documenting things like an API and the second was good if I ever
  need to make a screen-cast. I doubt that will happen, but you never know!
* The last talk "All roads might not lead to docs" held too main takeaways for
  me: The quote *The Purpose of this document is ________* and the `mailchimp
  voice & tone guide`_, which is a very good document I suggest you read it
  (the title is pretty self explanatory I think).

For a full list of talks given at the conference, check out the `event's
schedule`_.

The after party ended up happening at two venues since we got pre-maturely
kicked out of the first one; we made the best of it and I got to talk to Anna
Jaruga (the cloud research scientist) as well as a `Mozilla Development
Network`_ writer, both very interesting people.
